In Europe, Viking longships were developed from the use of "clinker" or overlapped planking though later European vessels favoured more rounded hulls with a broad beam and heavily curved at both ends.

In Europa wurden Wikinger-Langschiffe aus "Klinker" oder überlappenden Beplankungen entwickelt, obwohl spätere europäische Schiffe eher abgerundete Rümpfe mit breiter Breite und stark gebogenen Rümpfen an beiden Enden bevorzugten. Zu den späteren Innovationen gehörten ein gerader Steuerpfosten, der die Montage eines beweglichen Ruders und eine gemischte Anordnung von Lateiner- und Rahsegeln auf Hochseeschiffen ermöglichte.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Cartography, or map making, is the practice of making geographical maps which developed in ancient Greece and Rome in the 6thC. BC. An early example was Ptolemy's map of the known world in the 2ndC. AD. Arab geographers began to translate the works of Greek geographers into Arabic and many "mappa mundi" were produced in early medieval Europe, but the first accurate atlas of maps was produced by the Arab geographer al-Idrisi in 1154, incorporating knowledge of Europe, Africa, the Indian Ocean and the Far East. Later European geographers relied heavily on previous maps and the observations of explorers but were aided by the introduction of the magnetic compass, telescope and sextant which improved the accuracy of map making greatly.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Kartografie (auch Kartographie) ist die Wissenschaft und Technik zur Darstellung der Erdoberfläche in topografischen und thematischen Karten, im einfachsten Fall Landkarten.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die ältesten Karten stammen bereits aus dem Neolithikum. Eine Wandmalerei zeigt eine zentralanatolische Siedlung um 6200 v. Chr. mit ihren Häusern und dem Doppelgipfel des Vulkans Hasan Dagi (3.270 m). Bedeutende frühe Zeugnisse stammen aus der babylonischen Zeit (geritzte Tontafeln).

Jahrhundert, und die im Auftrag König Rogers II. von Sizilien 1154 angefertigte Weltkarte Charta Rogeriana von Abu Abdallah al-Idrisi (auch Weltkarte des Idrisi genannt).[PARAGRAPH:2]Im späten Mittelalter entstanden die mappae mundi mit ihren bekanntesten Vertretern, der Ebstorfer Weltkarte (ca. 1235) und der Hereforder Weltkarte (ca. 1270). Parallel gab es bereits recht genaue Karten des Mittelmeeres, die sog. Portolankarten. Das Bild am Ende des Mittelalters zeigt der Globus des Nürnberger Gelehrten Martin Behaim von 1492.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]Cartography, or map making, is the practice of making geographical maps which developed in ancient Greece and Rome in the 6thC. BC. An early example was Ptolemy's map of the known world in the 2ndC. AD. Arab geographers began to translate the works of Greek geographers into Arabic and many "mappa mundi" were produced in early medieval Europe, but the first accurate atlas of maps was produced by the Arab geographer al-Idrisi in 1154, incorporating knowledge of Europe, Africa, the Indian Ocean and the Far East. Later European geographers relied heavily on previous maps and the observations of explorers but were aided by the introduction of the magnetic compass, telescope and sextant which improved the accuracy of map making greatly.</Italian>

Mit der Verbreitung des Islam wurde Arabisch zur Schriftsprache der eroberten Länder und Arabisch wurde zu einer wichtigen Weltsprache. Während und nach dieser Zeit verwendeten Menschen unterschiedlichster ethnischer Herkunft Arabisch als ihre literarische Sprache. Die erste große Literatur, die in dieser Sprache verfasst wurde, bestand aus Gedichten, insbesondere Qasidas, epischen Gedichten, die ursprünglich mündlich vorgetragen wurden und den Sagen der nordischen Länder ähnelten. Diese wurden während der Umayyaden-Dynastie (661-750 n. Chr.) niedergeschrieben. Mit dem Aufstieg der Abbasiden-Dynastie (750-1258) kamen zu den Qasidas allgemeine Schriften hinzu, die als Adab bekannt sind, ein Wort, das heute Literatur, damals aber Verfeinerung bedeutete. Adab bezog sich auf das Schreiben von Prosa, das den Leser durch die Bereitstellung von Informationen über die Welt um ihn herum bildete und verfeinerte und Essays und buchlange Werke zu Themen wie Sprache und Stil, der Geschichte anderer Völker und Nationen, wissenschaftlichen Themen, intellektuellen und philosophischen Fragen usw. umfasste menschliche Natur. Während das dunkle Zeitalter Europa im Griff von Angst, Aberglauben und Unwissenheit hielt, machten die Länder der muslimischen Welt weiter, indem sie die wichtigsten Werke der westlichen Wissenschaft übersetzten und diesen Vorrat durch ihr kontinuierliches Streben nach Wissen ergänzten. Diese arabischen Texte, von denen einige aus Cordoba-Spanien stammen, viele andere jedoch aus Plünderungen während der Kreuzzüge stammen, ermöglichten es Europa, viele Geheimnisse zurückzugewinnen, die es zuvor verloren hatte.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Agriculture is the science of cultivating soil, planting and harvesting crops. It can be argued that the mastery of agriculture was the single most important step towards creating a civilization, as agriculture allowed people to stop hunting and gathering and settle down in one place. Villages and cities would be unviable without some form of agriculture. [PARAGRAPH:2]Evidence of plant cultivation dates back as far as 6000 BC. Apparently, grains were some of the earliest crops cultivated. Grains are incredibly useful foodstuffs; they can be ground into flour and turned into bread, they can be fed to livestock and, perhaps most importantly, they can be stored for months without spoiling. [PARAGRAPH:2]Over time a number of important tools were invented to aid in cultivation and preparation of grains. The sickle was an early innovation; it allowed the grain to be harvested far quicker than by hand. Hand mills and mortar and pestles were created to grind the finished product, and pots to store it. As man learned about fertilization and irrigation, it became possible to get consistently larger yields, which lessoned the chances of famine and increased the numbers that could be fed from each field.</English>

		<English>[TAB]A welfare state is a concept of government where the state plays a key role in the protection and promotion of the economic and social well-being of its citizens. The Islamic Caliphate has been described as the world's first major welfare state, largely due to the Islamic concepts of Zakat and Khums. Zakat is a form of mandatory charity. Once a year, any able Muslim is obligied to give away some amount (usually 2.5 percent) of his wealth to the poor. Khums is the tradition of giving one-fifth of one's wealth to the Islamic cause, e.g. to fund the building of a mosque. In Sunni view, this only applies to spoils of war, whereas Shias believe that it also applies to monetary profit in general.</English>

Das islamische Kalifat wurde als der erste große Wohlfahrtsstaat der Welt beschrieben, was vor allem auf die islamischen Konzepte von Zakat und Khums zurückzuführen ist. Zakat ist eine Form der obligatorischen Wohltätigkeit. Einmal im Jahr ist jeder fähige Muslim verpflichtet, einen Teil (normalerweise 2,5 Prozent) seines Vermögens an die Armen zu spenden. Khums ist die Tradition, ein Fünftel seines Vermögens für die islamische Sache zu spenden, z.B. um den Bau einer Moschee zu finanzieren. Aus sunnitischer Sicht gilt dies nur für Kriegsbeute, während Schiiten davon ausgehen, dass dies auch für Geldgewinne im Allgemeinen gilt.</German>

In the 10th century, al-Sufi first described over 1,000 different uses of an astrolabe, in areas as diverse as astronomy, astrology, horoscopes, navigation, surveying, timekeeping, prayer, Salah, Qibla, etc.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]The stirrup is a ring with a flat bottom fixed on a leather strap, usually hung from each side of a saddle to create a footrest for the rider on a riding animal (usually a horse or other equine, such as mule), suspended by an adjustable strap from the saddle for use as a support for the foot of a rider of a horse when seated in the saddle and as an aid in mounting. It greatly increases the rider's ability to control the mount, increasing the animal's usefulness in communication, transportation and warfare. It is considered one of the basic tools used to create and spread modern civilization. Some argue it is as important as the wheel or printing press. [PARAGRAPH:2]The stirrup was invented relatively late in history, considering that horses were domesticated approximately 4,500 BC. The first dependable representation of a rider with paired stirrups was found in China in a Jin Dynasty tomb of about 322 AD.

Braced against the stirrups, a knight could deliver a blow with a lance that employed the full weight and momentum of horse and rider together. Reacting to a sudden and urgent demand for cavalry, Charlemagne ordered his poorer vassals to pool their resources and provide a mounted and armed knight.

		<German>[TAB]Der Steigbügel ist ein Ring mit flachem Boden, der an einem Lederband befestigt ist und normalerweise an beiden Seiten eines Sattels aufgehängt wird, um dem Reiter auf einem Reittier (normalerweise einem Pferd oder einem anderen Pferd, z. B. einem Maultier) eine Fußstütze zu bieten. Mit einem verstellbaren Riemen am Sattel aufgehängt, dient es als Stütze für den Fuß eines Reiters, wenn er im Sattel sitzt, und als Hilfe beim Aufsteigen. Es verbessert die Fähigkeit des Reiters, das Reittier zu kontrollieren, erheblich und erhöht so den Nutzen des Tieres bei der Kommunikation, beim Transport und in der Kriegsführung. Es gilt als eines der grundlegenden Werkzeuge zur Schaffung und Verbreitung der modernen Zivilisation. Manche behaupten, es sei genauso wichtig wie das Rad oder die Druckerpresse. [PARAGRAPH:2]Der Steigbügel wurde relativ spät in der Geschichte erfunden, wenn man bedenkt, dass Pferde etwa 4.500 v. Chr. domestiziert wurden. Die erste verlässliche Darstellung eines Reiters mit gepaarten Steigbügeln wurde in China in einem Grab der Jin-Dynastie aus dem Jahr 322 n. Chr. gefunden. Der Steigbügel verbreitete sich durch die Reiter der zentralasiatischen Steppen in ganz Eurasien. Die Griechen und Römer nutzten sie nicht, sondern montierten sie durch Gewölbe oder von einem Montageblock aus. Im 7. Jahrhundert verbreiteten sich Steigbügel vor allem dank Eindringlingen aus Zentralasien, wie den Mongolen, über Asien nach Europa. Im 8. Jahrhundert scheinen sie von den Europäern übernommen worden zu sein. In Mitteleuropa wurden Steigbügel erstmals während der Herrschaft von Karl Martell indirekt dokumentiert. [ABSATZ:2]Beim Einsatz von Pferden in der Kriegsführung war der Steigbügel nach dem Streitwagen und dem Sattel des berittenen Reiters der dritte revolutionäre Ausrüstungsschritt. Steigbügel veränderten die Grundtaktiken der berittenen Kriegsführung und machten die Kavallerie wichtiger. An die Steigbügel gestützt, konnte ein Ritter mit einer Lanze einen Schlag ausführen, bei dem das gesamte Gewicht und der Schwung von Pferd und Reiter zusammenkamen. Als Reaktion auf einen plötzlichen und dringenden Bedarf an Kavallerie befahl Karl der Große seinen ärmeren Vasallen, ihre Ressourcen zu bündeln und einen berittenen und bewaffneten Ritter zur Verfügung zu stellen. Durch das Hinzufügen von Steigbügeln konnte ein Reiter auch einen längeren (und wesentlich stärkeren) Bogen verwenden, indem er auf den Steigbügeln stand.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Medieval European knights attacked in several different ways, implementing shock tactics if possible, but always in formations of several knights, not individually. For defense and melee a formation of horsemen was as tight as possible next to each other in a line. This preventing their enemy from charging, and also from surrounding them individually. With their heavy and armoured chargers knights trampled through the enemy infantry. The most devastating charging method was to ride in a looser formation fast into attack. This attack was often protected by simultaneous or shortly preceding ranged attacks of archers or crossbowmen. The attack began from a distance of about 350 metres and took about 15-20 seconds to cross the contemporary long range weapon's effective distance. A most important element, and one not easily mastered, was to stay in one line with fixed spaces while accelerating and having the maximum speed at impact. Often knights would come in several waves, with the first being the best equipped and armored. The lance as primary weapon pierced the enemy. If an enemy soldier was hit in full gallop by a knight's lance embedded under the armpit, he was thrown backwards with such a momentum that he knocked over several of his compatriots. The heavy lances were dropped after the attack and the battle was continued with secondary weapons (sword, axe, mace or likewise).</English>

Zur Verteidigung und zum Nahkampf wurde eine Reiterformation möglichst dicht nebeneinander in einer Linie aufgestellt. Dies verhindert, dass der Feind angreift und ihn einzeln umzingelt. Mit ihren schweren und gepanzerten Streitrossen zertrampelten die Ritter die feindliche Infanterie. Die verheerendste Angriffsmethode bestand darin, in einer lockeren Formation schnell in den Angriff zu reiten. Dieser Angriff wurde oft durch gleichzeitige oder kurz vorhergehende Fernangriffe von Bogenschützen oder Armbrustschützen geschützt. Der Angriff begann aus einer Entfernung von etwa 350 Metern und dauerte etwa 15 bis 20 Sekunden, um die effektive Reichweite moderner Langstreckenwaffen zu überschreiten. Ein äußerst wichtiges und nicht leicht zu beherrschendes Element bestand darin, beim Beschleunigen in einer Linie mit festen Abständen zu bleiben und beim Aufprall die maximale Geschwindigkeit zu erreichen. Oft kamen Ritter in mehreren Wellen, wobei die erste die am besten ausgerüstete und gepanzerte war. Die Lanze als Hauptwaffe durchbohrte den Feind. Wurde ein feindlicher Soldat im vollen Galopp von einer unter der Achselhöhle eingelassenen Ritterlanze getroffen, wurde er mit solcher Wucht nach hinten geschleudert, dass er mehrere seiner Landsleute umwarf. Nach dem Angriff wurden die schweren Lanzen abgeworfen und der Kampf mit Sekundärwaffen (Schwert, Axt, Streitkolben o.ä.) fortgesetzt.</German>

Diese Einheiten wurden in verschiedenen Kampfmanövern geschult und operierten mit einer Disziplin, die zwar nicht den Standards der Legionäre entsprach, aber immer noch weit entfernt war von dem wilden, schreienden Angriff, der das Markenzeichen der antiken Kriegsführung in Europa war, und der Hinzufügung schwerer Panzerung zur gewöhnlichen Infanterie Truppen, die bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt in Europa undenkbar waren, stellten einen dramatischen Fortschritt für die Überlebensfähigkeit der Einheiten dar.

Since the rudder for right-handed operation facing forward was usually attached to the right side of early sailing ships, the nautical term for this side of the ship was starboard.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]Ships in ancient times mostly had two rudders mounted aft on each side, the later Viking longships had one lateral rudder. The Hanseatic cogs in the Middle Ages, on the other hand, had a stern rudder. The first evidence from this period is a 13th-century wall drawing in the church of Fide (Gotland). The tiller of this rudder, which was much larger there, was moved with the Kolder stick, which served as an additional lever. The rudder is still known today from the Steinhuder Torfkahn.

		<German>[TAB]Burgen erfüllten im mittelalterlichen Europa viele Funktionen; Sie waren nicht nur beeindruckende Verteidigungsanlagen, sondern dienten auch als Verwaltungs- und Gerichtszentren sowie als Sitz der Macht eines Herrschers. Da in Burgen Lebensmittel und Vorräte gelagert werden konnten, übten Burgen einen starken Einfluss auf sehr große umliegende Gebiete aus. Weltliche Herren waren nicht die einzigen, die Burgen bauten; Oftmals taten dies auch religiöse Amtsträger, um sich eine stärkere Machtbasis zu verschaffen. Frühe Burgen waren in der Regel kaum mehr als hölzerne Palisaden, die auf Erdhügeln errichtet und vielleicht von einem flachen Graben umgeben waren; Zur Zeit der Herrschaft Eduards des Bekenners im England des 13. Jahrhunderts war der Burgbau zu einer viel aufwändigeren Angelegenheit geworden, da Hunderte von Arbeitern und Spezialisten an sorgfältig ausgewählten geografischen Standorten riesige Steinfestungen mit komplizierten Verteidigungsanlagen errichteten.</German>

Insgesamt begann das Drillen als wesentlicher Bestandteil einer Kriegsmaschinerie, als Philipp II. von Mazedonien seine Armee disziplinierte, damit sie schnell die Phalanxen bilden konnte, die für seine Erfolge als General so entscheidend waren. Militärübungen wurden später von der römischen Armee im Laufe ihrer langen Geschichte eingesetzt, um die Effizienz und Tödlichkeit zu maximieren. Nach dem Untergang des Reiches und dem Beginn des Mittelalters in Europa verließen sich die meisten Feudalherren bei der Führung ihrer Kriege stärker auf Bauernaushebungen und ihre wohlhabenden Ritter, und Militärübungen wurden meist nur von den führenden Armeen und Nationen durchgeführt, wie z die Normannen.</German>

		<German>[TAB]Zu Beginn des 14. Jahrhunderts bestanden die effektivsten Armeen aus professionellen, bezahlten Truppen. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt waren diese Krieger größtenteils Söldner, da Könige und Magnaten noch nicht reich genug waren, um ihre Armeen dauerhaft zu unterhalten. Das alte System der Truppenaufstellung durch feudale Verpflichtung war inzwischen zusammengebrochen. Dieses System verpflichtete in seiner gebräuchlichsten Form jeden Landbesitzer, seinem Oberherrn jährlich 40 Tage Militärdienst zu leisten. In der Praxis hing die Verpflichtung auch von der Landmenge und dem Kleingedruckten in der ursprünglichen Vereinbarung ab. Da der König der "Oberherr aller Oberherren" war, konnte er theoretisch eine enorme Anzahl an Truppen aufstellen. In der Praxis waren die feudalen Armeen oft recht wirkungslos. Zum einen enthielt die feudale Verpflichtung eine Ausweichklausel, die es den Rittern ermöglichte, Geld zu zahlen ("scutage"), anstatt zu erscheinen, wenn sie gerufen wurden. Darüber hinaus versprachen viele Ritter zu zahlen und kamen irgendwie nie dazu. Sogar die Truppen, die auftauchten, wollten normalerweise sofort nach Ablauf der 40-Tage-Pflicht nach Hause gehen, oder sogar früher, wenn sie damit durchkommen konnten. Da ein Feldzug in der Regel länger als 40 Tage dauerte, konnte sich diese Frist für den Anführer des Feudalheeres als sehr ungünstig erweisen. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt hatten die Engländer das traditionelle Feudalsystem abgeschafft und durch ein System ersetzt, bei dem die Feudalherren immer noch verpflichtet waren, Truppen bereitzustellen, diese jedoch bezahlt wurden und so lange im Dienst blieben, wie der König dies leisten konnte Lohn-und Gehaltsabrechnung. Die Franzosen waren auf dem Weg zu einem ähnlichen System, obwohl sie nicht so gut organisiert waren wie die Engländer und dies auch erst nach Kriegsende der Fall sein würde. [PARAGRAPH:2]Zu Beginn des 14. Jahrhunderts hatte die Idee des Söldner-Militärdienstes in Europa großen Anklang gefunden.

Plumbing systems designed to remove wastewater from dwellings and public buildings became commonplace, as did sewage plants which treated the wastewater before it was dumped into local waterways. Landfills were established, and garbage was collected for sanitary disposal in dumps and landfills a safe distance from the general population. These measures led to a healthier environment, and allowed for further population growth.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]Flintlock is a general term for any firearm that uses a flint-striking ignition mechanism, the first of which appeared in Western Europe in the early 16th century. The term may also apply to a particular form of the mechanism itself, also known as the true flintlock, that was introduced in the early 17th century, and gradually replaced earlier firearm-ignition technologies, such as the matchlock, the wheellock, and the earlier flintlock mechanisms such as snaplock and snaphaunce. The true flintlock continued to be in common use for over two centuries, replaced by percussion cap and, later, the cartridge-based systems in the early-to-mid 19th century. Although long superseded by modern firearms, flintlock weapons enjoy continuing popularity with black-powder shooting enthusiasts.</English>

Das echte Steinschloss war noch über zwei Jahrhunderte lang gebräuchlich und wurde Anfang bis Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts durch Perkussionskappen- und später durch Patronensysteme ersetzt.

		<English>[TAB]The Matchlock was the first mechanism or "lock" invented to facilitate the firing of a hand-held firearm. It was invented in Europe some time in the mid 1400s, although the idea of the serpentine appears some 40 years previously in an Austrian manuscript. The first dated illustration of a matchlock mechanism dates to 1475, and by the 1500s they were universally used.

The flash from the primer travelled through the touch hole igniting the main charge of propellant in the gun barrel. This design removed the need to lower a lighted match into the flashpan by hand and made it possible to have both hands free to keep a firm grip on the weapon at the moment of firing, and to keep both eyes on the target. [PARAGRAPH:2]An inherent weakness of the matchlock was the necessity of keeping the match constantly lit. Being the sole source of ignition for the powder, if the match was not lit when the gun needed to be fired, the mechanism was useless, and the weapon became little more than an expensive club. This was chiefly a problem in wet weather, when damp match cord was difficult to light and to keep burning. Another drawback was the burning match itself. At night, the match would glow in the darkness, potentially giving away the carrier's position. The distinctive smell of burning match-cord was also a give away of a musketeer's position. It was also quite dangerous when a group of men were speedily handling large quantities of gunpowder along with lighted matches. This was one reason why soldiers in charge of transporting and guarding gunpowder were amongst the first to be issued self-igniting guns like the wheellock and snaphance.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Das Luntenschloss war der erste Mechanismus oder "Schloss", der erfunden wurde, um das Abfeuern einer Handfeuerwaffe zu erleichtern. Sie wurde irgendwann in der Mitte des 15. Jahrhunderts in Europa erfunden, obwohl die Idee der Serpentine etwa 40 Jahre zuvor in einem österreichischen Manuskript auftauchte. Die erste datierte Abbildung eines Luntenschlossmechanismus stammt aus dem Jahr 1475 und im 16. Jahrhundert waren sie allgemein verbreitet. [PARAGRAPH:2]Eine Weiterentwicklung der Flash-Pan-Technologie: Die klassische europäische Luntenschlosspistole hielt ein brennendes, langsames Streichholz in einer Klemme am Ende eines kleinen gebogenen Hebels, der als Serpentine bekannt ist. Durch Ziehen eines zweiten Hebels (oder bei späteren Modellen eines Abzugs), der aus der Unterseite der Waffe herausragte und mit der Serpentine verbunden war, senkte sich die Klammer, senkte das brennende Streichholz in die Blitzpfanne und entzündete das Zündpulver. Der Blitz des Zündhütchens gelangte durch das Zündloch und zündete die Haupttreibstoffladung im Geschützrohr. Diese Konstruktion machte es überflüssig, ein brennendes Streichholz von Hand in die Blitzpfanne zu senken, und ermöglichte es, beide Hände frei zu haben, um die Waffe im Moment des Abfeuerns fest im Griff zu behalten und beide Augen auf das Ziel gerichtet zu halten. [PARAGRAPH:2]Eine inhärente Schwäche des Luntenschlosses war die Notwendigkeit, das Streichholz ständig brennen zu lassen. Da das Streichholz die einzige Zündquelle für das Pulver darstellte, war der Mechanismus nutzlos, wenn das Streichholz nicht angezündet wurde, als die Waffe abgefeuert werden musste, und die Waffe wurde kaum mehr als ein teurer Schläger. Dies war vor allem bei nassem Wetter ein Problem, wenn feuchte Streichholzschnur schwer anzuzünden und weiter zu brennen war. Ein weiterer Nachteil war das brennende Streichholz selbst. Nachts leuchtete das Streichholz in der Dunkelheit und verriet möglicherweise die Position des Trägers. Auch der charakteristische Geruch brennender Streichholzschnur verriet die Position eines Musketiers. Es war auch ziemlich gefährlich, wenn eine Gruppe von Männern schnell große Mengen Schießpulver und brennende Streichhölzer handhabte. Dies war einer der Gründe, warum Soldaten, die für den Transport und die Bewachung von Schießpulver zuständig waren, zu den ersten gehörten, denen selbstzündende Waffen wie die Radschloss- und die Snaphance-Waffen ausgehändigt wurden.</German>

		<English>[TAB]The Age of Discovery or Age of Exploration was a period from the early 15th century and continuing into the early 17th century, during which European ships traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners to feed burgeoning capitalism in Europe. They also were in search of trading goods such as gold, silver and spices. In the process, Europeans encountered peoples and mapped lands previously unknown to them. Among the most famous explorers of the period were Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Pedro Alvares Cabral, John Cabot, Yermak, Juan Ponce de Leon, Juan Sebastian Elcano, Bartholomew Dias, Ferdinand Magellan, Willem Barentsz, Abel Tasman, Jacques Cartier, Samuel de Champlain, Willem Jansz and Captain James Cook. [PARAGRAPH:2]The Age of Exploration was rooted in new technologies and ideas growing out of the Renaissance. These included advances in cartography, navigation, firepower and shipbuilding. Many people wanted to find a route to Asia through the west of Europe. The most important development was the invention of first the carrack and then caravel in Iberia. These vessels evolved from medieval European designs with a fruitful combination of Mediterranean and North Sea innovations and the addition of some Arabic elements. They were the first ships that could leave the relatively placid and calm Mediterranean and sail safely on the open Atlantic.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Das Zeitalter der Entdeckungen oder Zeitalter der Erforschung war eine Zeit vom frühen 15. Jahrhundert bis ins frühe 17. Jahrhundert, in der europäische Schiffe um die Welt reisten, um nach neuen Handelsrouten und Partnern zu suchen, um den aufkeimenden Kapitalismus in Europa zu ernähren. Sie waren auch auf der Suche nach Handelsgütern wie Gold, Silber und Gewürzen. Dabei begegneten die Europäer Völkern und kartierten Länder, die ihnen zuvor unbekannt waren. Zu den berühmtesten Entdeckern dieser Zeit gehörten Christoph Kolumbus, Vasco da Gama, Pedro Alvares Cabral, John Cabot, Yermak, Juan Ponce de Leon, Juan Sebastian Elcano, Bartholomäus Dias, Ferdinand Magellan, Willem Barentsz, Abel Tasman, Jacques Cartier und Samuel de Champlain, Willem Jansz und Kapitän James Cook. [PARAGRAPH:2]Das Zeitalter der Entdeckungen hatte seine Wurzeln in neuen Technologien und Ideen, die aus der Renaissance hervorgingen. Dazu gehörten Fortschritte in der Kartographie, Navigation, Feuerkraft und im Schiffbau. Viele Menschen wollten einen Weg nach Asien durch den Westen Europas finden. Die wichtigste Entwicklung war die Erfindung zunächst der Karacke und dann der Karavelle in Iberien. Diese Schiffe entwickelten sich aus mittelalterlichen europäischen Designs mit einer fruchtbaren Kombination von Innovationen aus dem Mittelmeerraum und der Nordsee und der Hinzufügung einiger arabischer Elemente. Sie waren die ersten Schiffe, die das relativ ruhige Mittelmeer verlassen und sicher über den offenen Atlantik segeln konnten.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Mercantilism came into being shortly after the medieval states of Europe became true nation-states.  It is an economic worldview holding that all economic exchange is zero-sum (meaning that in any trade, there is a winner and a loser). According to mercantilism national governments needed to tightly control foreign trade and employment, and aggressively pursue colonies and foreign markets to profitably sell manufactured goods. Finally, mercantilism was associated with the idea that wealth was identical with stocks of gold and silver, or whatever was used as currency in a given economy. Mercantilism endured until the 18th century, when Adam Smith and the classical liberals of England and France set forth a series of devastating criticisms.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Der Merkantilismus entstand kurz nachdem die mittelalterlichen Staaten Europas zu echten Nationalstaaten wurden. Es handelt sich um eine wirtschaftliche Weltanschauung, die davon ausgeht, dass der gesamte wirtschaftliche Austausch ein Nullsummenspiel ist (was bedeutet, dass es bei jedem Handel einen Gewinner und einen Verlierer gibt). Dem Merkantilismus zufolge mussten nationale Regierungen den Außenhandel und die Beschäftigung streng kontrollieren und Kolonien und ausländische Märkte aggressiv verfolgen, um Industriegüter gewinnbringend zu verkaufen. Schließlich wurde der Merkantilismus mit der Idee in Verbindung gebracht, dass Reichtum mit Gold- und Silberbeständen oder was auch immer in einer bestimmten Wirtschaft als Währung verwendet wird, identisch sei. Der Merkantilismus hielt bis ins 18. Jahrhundert an, als Adam Smith und die klassischen Liberalen Englands und Frankreichs eine Reihe vernichtender Kritiken vorbrachten.</German>
