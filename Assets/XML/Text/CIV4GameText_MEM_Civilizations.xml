		<English>[TAB]The Karakhanids were a Turkic dynasty that ruled parts of Central Asia from the 9th through early 13th centuries. Their arrival in Transoxania signaled a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia, though the Karakhanids themselves gradually assimilated the local Perso-Arab Muslim culture. [PARAGRAPH:1]The Kara-Khanid Khanate was a confederation formed in the early 9th century by the Karluks, Yagmas, Chigils, and other Turkic peoples living in the Zhetysu, Western Tian Shan, and Western Xinjiang areas. By the mid-10th century, the Karakhanids had converted to Islam, and adopted Muslim names and honorifics while retaining Turkic regnal titles such as Khan, Khagan, Ilek and Tegin. Later on their rulers adopted the title sultan, though as was common of Turkic and Mongol nomads the Kara-Khanid state remained divided into appanages. By 950, they had absorbed Kashgar and were waging religious war against their Buddhist and Tengrist neighbors, reportedly prompting a mass conversion of Turks in the year 960.[PARAGRAPH:1]Starting in 990 the Karakhanids began full scale invasions of the Samanid domains. By 999, the Samanids had been largely destroyed and their lands split between the Karakhanids and the Ghaznavids. In 1006, the Buddhist Kingdom of Khotan was conquered, and the Kara-Khanid state was at its greatest extent and arguable peak. Early in the 11th century however, the unity of the Kara-Khanid dynasty was fractured by frequent internal warfare, and the state was eventually split into two independent parts. This disunity would contribute to the Karakhanids being successively vassalized or conquered by their more powerful neighbors, including the Seljuks and the Kara Khitai. They were finally extinguised in the early 13th century by the the Khwarezmshah, the Kara Khitai, and the Mongols. </English>

Until the mid-14th century, they acknowledged the authority of the descendants of Batu Khan and Orda Khan, such as Uzbeg Khan. The Shaybanid horde was converted to Islam in 1282 and gradually assumed the name of Uzbeks.[PARAGRAPH:1]As the lineages of Batu and Orda died out in the course of the great civil wars of the 14th century, the Shaybanids under Abu'l-Khayr Khan declared themselves the only legitimate successors to Jochi and put forward claims to the whole of his enormous ulus, which included parts of Siberia and Kazakhstan. Their rivals were the Timurids, who claimed descent from Jochi's thirteenth son by a concubine.

		<English>[TAB]The Kara Khitai was a Central Asian empire ruled by the Khitan Yelu clan. The dynasty was founded by Yelu Dashi, who led the remnants of the Liao dynasty to Central Asia after fleeing the Jurchen conquest of their teritory in China.[PARAGRAPH:1]When the Jurchens, once vassals of the Khitans, allied with the Song dynasty and overthrew the Liao, Yelu Dashi led a group of nomadic Khitans west by way of Mongolia. Dashi recruited Khitans and other tribes to form an army, and in 1134 captured Balasagun from the Kara-Khanid Khanate, which marked the start of the Kara Khitai empire in Central Asia. The Khitan forces were soon joined by 10,000 additional Khitans, who had been subjects of the Kara-Khanid Khanate. The Khitans then conquered Kashgar, Khotan, and Beshbalik. They defeated the Western Kara-Khanid Khanate at Khujand in 1137, eventually leading to Kara Khitai control over the Fergana Valley. On September 9, 1141, the Khitai won the Battle of Qatwan against the Western Kara-Khanids and the Seljuk Empire, which allowed them to gain control over Transoxiana.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Yelu Dashi died his wife Xiao Tabuyan became regent for their son. The son, Yelu Yilie, ruled from 1150 to 1163, to be succeeded by his sister, Yelu Pusuwan. She fell in love with her husband's younger brother, Xiao Fuguzhi. Both were killed in 1177 by her husband's father, Xiao Wolila, who then placed his son Yelu Zhilugu on the throne. During this time, the empire became weakened by rebellions and internal wars among its vassals. The empire contracted in the northeast when, in 1175, the Naimans east of the Altai and the Qangli north of Lake Balkhash made a partial submission to the Jurchens. In the west there were many conflicts with Khwarezm involving non-payment of tribute and rival claimants to the throne, though this did lead to some territorial expansion at Khwarezm's expense. In the south the Kara-Khanid vassals were lightly held and engaged in various conflicts with one another and their neighbors.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1208, a Naiman prince, Kuchlug, fled his homeland after being defeated by Mongols. Kuchlug was welcomed into the empire of the Kara Khitans, and was allowed to marry Yelu Zhilugu's daughter. However, in 1211, Kuchlug revolted, and later captured Yelu Zhilugu while the latter was hunting. Zhilugu was allowed to remain as the nominal ruler but died two years later, and many historians regard his death as the end of the Kara Khitan empire. In 1216, Genghis Khan dispatched his general Jebe to pursue Kuchlug; Kuchlug fled, but in 1218, he was finally captured and decapitated. The Mongols fully conquered the former territories of the Kara Khitans in 1220.</English>

He initially ruled as king from 1124 to 1132, then as emperor from 1132 to 1143. He fled the Liao dynasty in northern China as it was on the verge of destruction by the Jurchen Jin dynasty, in 1124 leading a band of his fellow Khitans northwest to the Liao garrison town of Kedun. Emperor Tianzuo of Liao was captured by the Jurchens in 1125, and the Liao dynasty was ended. As the Jurchens grew stronger, the disorganized lands to the west became an increasingly attractive prospect.[PARAGRAPH:1]On March 13, 1130, Dashi headed west with less than 20,000 men. After some minor fighting with the Yenisei Kyrgyz he established a new base on the Emil River about 1500 km west of Kedun. At about the same time, he was welcomed by the ruler of the Kingdom of Qocho who became his ally or vassal. In 1131 or 1132, he was proclaimed Gurkhan by his followers, establishing his authority over Almaliq and Qayaliq. The Eastern Karakanid ruler of Balasaghun, Ibrahim II b. Ahmad, invited him to help fight the Karluks and Kankalis, and in 1134 Dashi took the opportunuty to depose him.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dashi made Balasaghun his new capital, and took over 16,000 Khitans that had served the old ruler. He spread his power over Jetysu, later gaining control over what is now Xinjiang. In May 1137 he defeated a Western Karakhanid ruler at Khujand and then spent several years consolidating his power in the Ferghana valley and Tashkent. He died in 1143, two years after his victory at Qatwan, as the master of much of Central Asia.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Karakhanids were a Turkic dynasty that ruled parts of Central Asia from the 9th through early 13th centuries. Their arrival in Transoxania signaled a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia, though the Karakhanids themselves gradually assimilated the local Perso-Arab Muslim culture. [PARAGRAPH:1]The Kara-Khanid Khanate was a confederation formed in the early 9th century by the Karluks, Yagmas, Chigils, and other Turkic peoples living in the Zhetysu, Western Tian Shan, and Western Xinjiang areas. By the mid-10th century, the Karakhanids had converted to Islam, and adopted Muslim names and honorifics while retaining Turkic regnal titles such as Khan, Khagan, Ilek and Tegin. Later on their rulers adopted the title sultan, though as was common of Turkic and Mongol nomads the Kara-Khanid state remained divided into appanages. By 950, they had absorbed Kashgar and were waging religious war against their Buddhist and Tengrist neighbors, reportedly prompting a mass conversion of Turks in the year 960.[PARAGRAPH:1]Starting in 990 the Karakhanids began full scale invasions of the Samanid domains. By 999, the Samanids had been largely destroyed and their lands split between the Karakhanids and the Ghaznavids. In 1006, the Buddhist Kingdom of Khotan was conquered, and the Kara-Khanid state was at its greatest extent and arguable peak. Early in the 11th century however, the unity of the Kara-Khanid dynasty was fractured by frequent internal warfare, and the state was eventually split into two independent parts. This disunity would contribute to the Karakhanids being successively vassalized or conquered by their more powerful neighbors, including the Seljuks and the Kara Khitai. They were finally extinguised in the early 13th century by the the Khwarezmshah, the Kara Khitai, and the Mongols. </English>
		<French>[TAB]The Shaybanids are the patrilineal descendants of Shayban (Shiban), the fifth son of Jochi and grandson of Genghis Khan. Until the mid-14th century, they acknowledged the authority of the descendants of Batu Khan and Orda Khan, such as Uzbeg Khan. The Shaybanid horde was converted to Islam in 1282 and gradually assumed the name of Uzbeks.[PARAGRAPH:1]As the lineages of Batu and Orda died out in the course of the great civil wars of the 14th century, the Shaybanids under Abu'l-Khayr Khan declared themselves the only legitimate successors to Jochi and put forward claims to the whole of his enormous ulus, which included parts of Siberia and Kazakhstan. Their rivals were the Timurids, who claimed descent from Jochi's thirteenth son by a concubine. Several decades of strife left the Timurids in control of the Great Horde and its successor states in Europe, namely, the Khanates of Kazan, Astrakhan, and Crimea.[PARAGRAPH:1]However, the Shaybanids under Muhammad Shaybani were able to wrest control of Samarkand, Bukhara and (for a time) Herat from the Timurids, establishing the Shaybanid dynasty as rulers of the independent Khanates of Bukhora and Khwarezm (Khiva).</French>

Kaidu, who held much of the power in the khanate, appointed Duwa as ruler in an effort to gain peace between himself and the sons of Baraq. This ensured the loyalty of the Chaghataids from that point until Kaidu's death. In early 1295, Kaidu's attempts to spread his power within the Ilkhanate gave Duwa an excuse to invade that Mongol kingdom. Supported by Kaidu's son Sarban, he invaded Khurasan and Mazandaran while the Ilkhanid commanders were involved in a succession struggle far to the west. For eight months he stayed in Mazandaran; when he left, he pillaged many cities on the way back. Duwa attempted to convince the Kartids of Herat to defect to his side, but they refused. Due to a lack of progress he was recalled by Kaidu back to Central Asia, and the campaign ended.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the east, Duwa was engaged in constant conflict with the Yuan dynasty. When Kaidu died after battling against the Yuan, the political situation changed. Duwa ignored Kaidu's choice of successor, Orus, and instead picked Kaidu's firstborn son Chapar to take his father's place. Chapar was enthroned in 1303, thanks to Duwa's effort. Duwa insisted Chapar submit to Temur Khan, and around 1304 a general peace among the Mongol states was declared, finally ending the Kaidu-Kublai war. The settlement favored Duwa much more than Chapar, a fact which set a rift between the two. Fighting broke out between the troops of both parties, and the sons of Kaidu were ultimately defeated by Duwa with assistance from the Yuan. In 1307 Duwa died, to be succeeded by his own son Konchek.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Byzantine Empire was first known as the eastern Roman empire, when Constantine I relocated the Roman capital from Rome to Constantinople and his successor Valentinian I made the division between Western and Eastern Empire official.  When barbarians sacked Rome and defeated the western armies a century later, the Byzantine Empire was the final bulwark of Roman civilization to stand against the increasing pressure from European barbarians to the north and Persia in the east.  Byzantine government was based largely on that of Rome, although unlike Roman emperors a Byzantine emperor was elected by a threefold vote of the senate, the people, and the army.

Arriving in Constantinople to restore order after a disastrous interregnum (marred by assassination, intrigue, and civil disorder), Heraclius placed tremendous power in the hands of the army.  It was also during the reign of Heraclius that Greek fire, the medieval precursor to napalm, was invented, and used extensively by Byzantine ships called dromons in battle against Persian and barbarian ships. Heraclius also ordered the army to emulate the barbarian horse archers previously employed as mercenaries; the result was the cataphract, a heavily armored cavalryman who could fight with bow, sword, or lance.[PARAGRAPH:1]After two hundred years of defeats and erosion, during which Byzantium lost virtually all of its possessions south of Asia Minor, the ascension of Basil I to the imperial throne in 867 marked a turnaround in Byzantine military fortunes.  Byzantine armies beat back the Arabs in the east and south, and despite several humiliating defeats at the hands of the Muslims, reasserted dominance over the eastern Mediterranean.

		<German>[TAB]Das Byzantinische Reich wurde erstmals als Ostrmisches Reich bezeichnet, als Konstantin I. die rmische Hauptstadt von Rom nach Konstantinopel verlegte und sein Nachfolger Valentinian I. die Teilung zwischen West- und Ostrmischem Reich offiziell machte. Als die Barbaren ein Jahrhundert spter Rom plnderten und die westlichen Armeen besiegten, war das Byzantinische Reich das letzte Bollwerk der rmischen Zivilisation, das dem zunehmenden Druck europischer Barbaren im Norden und Persiens im Osten standhielt. Die byzantinische Regierung basierte grtenteils auf der rmischen Regierung, obwohl ein byzantinischer Kaiser im Gegensatz zu rmischen Kaisern durch eine dreifache Abstimmung des Senats, des Volkes und der Armee gewhlt wurde. Um das Reich zu regieren, sttzten sich die byzantinischen Kaiser auf ein labyrinthisches System aus Beratern, Ministerien und mtern  daher das abwertende byzantinisch, das heute verwendet wird, um bermig hierarchische und intrigenanfllige Systeme zu beschreiben.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die byzantinische Militrreform erfolgte grtenteils whrend der Herrschaft von Heraklius, dem Sohn des kaiserlichen Statthalters von Afrika. Als Heraklius nach einem katastrophalen Interregnum (getrbt durch Attentate, Intrigen und Unruhen) in Konstantinopel ankam, um die Ordnung wiederherzustellen, legte Heraklius enorme Macht in die Hnde der Armee. Whrend der Herrschaft von Heraklius wurde auch das griechische Feuer, der mittelalterliche Vorlufer von Napalm, erfunden und von byzantinischen Schiffen, sogenannten Dromonen, im Kampf gegen persische und barbarische Schiffe ausgiebig eingesetzt. Heraklius befahl der Armee auerdem, den barbarischen berittenen Bogenschtzen nachzueifern, die zuvor als Sldner eingesetzt worden waren. Das Ergebnis war der Kataphrakt, ein schwer gepanzerter Kavallerist, der mit Bogen, Schwert oder Lanze kmpfen konnte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nach zweihundert Jahren der Niederlagen und der Erosion, in denen Byzanz praktisch alle seine Besitztmer sdlich von Kleinasien verlor, wurde der Die Besteigung Basileios I. auf den Kaiserthron im Jahr 867 markierte eine Wende im byzantinischen Militrgeschick. Byzantinische Armeen schlugen die Araber im Osten und Sden zurck und behaupteten trotz mehrerer demtigender Niederlagen durch die Muslime erneut die Vorherrschaft ber das stliche Mittelmeer. Auch Syrien gelangte zusammen mit der Schlsselstadt Antiochia, Armenien und groen Teilen des Balkans wieder unter byzantinische Kontrolle. Byzanz erlebte 150 Jahre lang zivilen Wohlstand und militrische Siege.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aber neue Gegner tauchten dort auf, wo die alten gefallen waren. Im Jahr 1071 erlitt Byzanz zwei katastrophale Niederlagen  es verlor seinen letzten Halt in Italien an die Normannen, die zuvor Konstantinopel whrend eines fehlgeschlagenen Kreuzzugs geplndert hatten. Im Osten brachen die Trken bei Manzikert die byzantinische Macht in Kleinasien fr immer, und das einst dominierende Reich wurde auf einen Rumpfstaat reduziert, der Konstantinopel, Teile des Balkans und einige verbleibende Provinzen in der Westtrkei umfasste. Das Herzstck davon wurde jedoch nun von den Trken beherrscht. Dennoch blhten in dieser Zeit Kunst, Religion und Philosophie innerhalb der Mauern von Konstantinopel auf. Es war, als ob die gelehrten Mnner von Byzanz sich der Bedrohungen, die drauen lauerten, nicht bewusst waren. Ein weiteres schicksalhaftes Ereignis, das Schisma von 1054, vollendete die Trennung zwischen der byzantinischen (stlichen) und der katholischen (westlichen) Kirche. Dies wrde zu tiefem Misstrauen zwischen den beiden Kirchen und zu einer Zurckhaltung des Westens fhren, Byzanz Jahre spter im Kampf gegen die Trken zu untersttzen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Schlielich war Byzanz gezwungen, auf Bestechung und Kompromisse mit den Trken und den neuen westlichen Mchten zurckzugreifen, die sein Territorium begehrten und frherer Einfluss. Im Jahr 1421, nach hundertjhriger Koexistenz mit den Trken, widerrief der neue Sultan Murad II. alle zwischen den beiden Reichen bestehenden Vereinbarungen. Als letzten Ausweg flehte der byzantinische Kaiser Rom um Hilfe an, doch die zum Kampf gegen die Trken entsandte christliche Armee wurde vllig besiegt. Im Jahr 1453 griffen die Trken Konstantinopel selbst an und die Mauern, die ber tausend Jahre lang gestanden hatten, fielen schlielich, was das Ende des Byzantinischen Reiches bedeutete.</German>

The period from roughly 750 to 1150 saw the kingdom stable and prosperous, in what has been called the "Golden Age". Increased aggression from Egypt, and internal discord led to the state's collapse in the 14th century.</Italian>

		<English>[TAB]The Arab descendants of Abbas, an uncle of the Prophet Muhammad, began a rebellion against the unpopular Umayyad Caliphate in 747 AD. Within a few years they had massacred most of the Umayyad dynasty and established the Abbasid Caliphate, which would last for the next five hundred years. At its greatest extent in the late 8th century, the Caliphate controlled Morocco on the Atlantic Ocean to central Asia as far as the borders of India. They also contributed much toward scientific progress at a time when European culture was stagnant and backwards. [PARAGRAPH:1]One of the first things the Abbasids did was to move the administrative center away from Damascus to Mesopotamia. In 762 AD the second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur, began the construction of a new capital city. The site he chose was on the banks of the Tigris at a small village called Baghdad. The new city was originally built with three concentric round walls. The caliphate palace and parks occupied the center and were surrounded by a ring of military barracks and offices, which in turn were surrounded by housing. Suburbs quickly appeared beyond the outer wall, and by 800 AD the city had half a million residents, and would continue to grow over the next several centuries. Because it was the principal trade center to the silks of China and the spices of India, Baghdad became the wealthiest city in the world at its height. It was filled with marble palaces of several stories, gardens, beautiful mosques, immense main avenues, and aqueducts. [PARAGRAPH:1]Such wealth attracted invaders. By the early 10th century Buyid mercenaries from Iran gained temporal power, sacking parts of Baghdad in 945 AD, and subordinating the caliph to a puppet with spiritual authority at best.

The Muslim Seljuks also retained the caliph, respecting his symbolic role, but they were not averse to replacing him with another as desired.

		<German>[TAB]Die arabischen Nachkommen von Abbas, einem Onkel des Propheten Mohammed, begannen 747 n. Chr. einen Aufstand gegen das unbeliebte Umayyaden-Kalifat. Innerhalb weniger Jahre hatten sie den grten Teil der Umayyaden-Dynastie massakriert und das Abbasiden-Kalifat gegrndet, das die nchsten fnfhundert Jahre bestehen sollte. In seiner grten Ausdehnung kontrollierte das Kalifat im spten 8. Jahrhundert Marokko vom Atlantischen Ozean ber Zentralasien bis zu den Grenzen Indiens. Sie trugen auch viel zum wissenschaftlichen Fortschritt in einer Zeit bei, als die europische Kultur stagnierte und rckstndig war. [PARAGRAPH:1] Eines der ersten Dinge, die die Abbasiden taten, war die Verlegung des Verwaltungszentrums von Damaskus nach Mesopotamien. Im Jahr 762 n. Chr. begann der zweite abbasidische Kalif, al-Mansur, mit dem Bau einer neuen Hauptstadt. Der Standort, den er whlte, lag am Ufer des Tigris in einem kleinen Dorf namens Bagdad. Die neue Stadt wurde ursprnglich mit drei konzentrischen Rundmauern erbaut. Der Kalifatpalast und die Parks befanden sich im Zentrum und waren von einem Ring aus Militrkasernen und Bros umgeben, die wiederum von Wohnhusern umgeben waren. Hinter der Auenmauer entstanden schnell Vororte, und im Jahr 800 n. Chr. hatte die Stadt eine halbe Million Einwohner und wuchs in den nchsten Jahrhunderten weiter. Da es das wichtigste Handelszentrum fr die Seidenstoffe aus China und die Gewrze aus Indien war, wurde Bagdad auf seinem Hhepunkt zur reichsten Stadt der Welt. Es war voller Marmorpalste mit mehreren Stockwerken, Grten, wunderschnen Moscheen, riesigen Hauptstraen und Aqudukten. [PARAGRAPH:1]Solcher Reichtum lockte Eindringlinge an. Zu Beginn des 10. Jahrhunderts erlangten Buyid-Sldner aus dem Iran weltliche Macht, plnderten 945 n. Chr. Teile Bagdads und unterstellten den Kalifen bestenfalls einer Marionette mit spiritueller Autoritt. Die Buyiden wiederum wurden von nomadischen seldschukischen Trken aus Zentralasien vertrieben. Auch die muslimischen Seldschuken behielten den Kalifen aus Respekt vor seiner symbolischen Rolle, waren aber nicht abgeneigt, ihn nach Wunsch durch einen anderen zu ersetzen. [PARAGRAPH:1]Nachdem die Kreuzzge im 12. Jahrhundert das Seldschukenreich erodierten, erlangte das abbasidische Kalifat die weltliche Macht ber Sdmesopotamien zurck. Doch innerhalb von hundert Jahren tauchte ein neuer und gnadenloser Eindringling aus den asiatischen Steppen auf. 1258 eroberten die Mongolen Bagdad. Sie massakrierten Hunderttausende ihrer Brger, machten die Stadt dem Erdboden gleich, zerstrten ihr Bewsserungssystem und trampelten den Kalifen al-Mustasim mit Pferden zu Tode, was der Abbasiden-Dynastie ein gewaltsames Ende bereitete.</German>

An example of what is known to be factual is the story of the Clock that was among various presents that Harun had delightfully sent to Charlemagne. The presents were carried by the returning Frankish mission that came to offer Harun friendship in 799. Charlemagne and his retinue deemed the clock to be a conjuration for the sounds it emanates and the tricks it displays every time an hour ticks. Among what is known to be fictional is the famous The Book of One Thousand and One Nights containing many stories that are fantasized by Harun's magnificent court, and even Harun al-Rashid himself. The family of Barmakids which played a deciding role in establishing the Abbasid Caliphate declined gradually during his rule.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]The Zengid (or Zangid) dynasty was a Muslim dynasty of Turkic origin, which ruled parts of Syria and northern Iraq on behalf of the Seljuk Empire. The dynasty was founded by Imad ad-Din Zengi (or Zangi), who became the Seljuk Atabeg (governor) of Mosul in 1127. He quickly became the chief Turkish potentate in Northern Syria and Iraq, taking Aleppo from the squabbling Ortoqid emirs in 1128, and capturing the County of Edessa from the Crusaders in 1144. This latter feat made Zengi a hero in the Muslim world, but he was assassinated by a slave two years later, in 1146.[PARAGRAPH:1]On Zengi's death, his territories were divided, with Mosul and his lands in Iraq going to his eldest son Saif ad-Din Ghazi I, and Aleppo and Edessa falling to his second son, Nur ad-Din Mahmud. Nur ad-Din proved to be as competent as his father. In 1149 he defeated and killed Prince Raymond of Antioch in battle, and the next year conquered the remnants of the County of Edessa west of the Euphrates River. In 1154 he capped off these successes by his capture of Damascus from the Burid Emirs who ruled it.[PARAGRAPH:1]Now ruling from Damascus, Nur ad-Din's success continued. Another Prince of Antioch, Raynald of Chtillon was captured, and the territories of that Principality greatly reduced. In the 1160s, Nur ad-Din's attention was mostly held by a competition with the King of Jerusalem, Amalric I, for control of the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt.

Nach der Ermordung seines Vaters Nur ad-Din und seines lteren Bruders Saif ad-Din Ghazi teilte ich das Knigreich untereinander auf, wobei Nur ad-Din Aleppo regierte und Saif ad-Din Ghazi sich in Mossul niederlie. Fast gleich zu Beginn seiner Herrschaft griff Nur ad-Din das Frstentum Antiochia an und eroberte mehrere Burgen im Norden Syriens, whrend er gleichzeitig einen Versuch von Joscelin II., die Grafschaft Edessa zurckzugewinnen, vereitelte 1144 von Zengi erobert. [PARAGRAPH:1]Es war Nur ad-Dins Traum, die verschiedenen muslimischen Streitkrfte zwischen Euphrat und Nil zu vereinen, um eine gemeinsame Front gegen die Kreuzfahrer zu bilden. Im Jahr 1149 wurde Nur ad-Din als Oberherr von Mossul anerkannt, sodass die Grostdte Mossul und Aleppo unter einem Mann vereint wurden. Im Jahr 1154 wurde der Emir von Damaskus gestrzt, die Stadt dem Gebiet der Zengiden angegliedert und ganz Syrien von Edessa im Norden bis Hauran im Sden unter der Herrschaft von Nur ad-Din vereint. [PARAGRAPH:1]Da die Kreuzfahrer nun in Syrien nichts mehr tun konnten, waren sie gezwungen, nach Sden zu blicken, und nach einer Reihe von Kriegen eroberten sie den geschwchten Fatimiden Alexandrira und Kairo. Nur ad-Din schickte Shirkuh, seinen kurdischen General, um die Ordnung wiederherzustellen. Shirkuh eroberte gypten zurck und wurde zum Wesir ernannt, dessen Nachfolger spter sein Neffe Saladin wurde. Nur ad-Din glaubte, sein Ziel, die muslimischen Staaten zu vereinen, erreicht zu haben, doch Saladin wollte sich seiner Autoritt nicht unterwerfen. [PARAGRAPH:1]Als Nur ad-Din im Jahr 1174 kurz davor stand, in gypten einzumarschieren, wurde er aufgrund von Komplikationen aufgrund eines Peritonsillarabszesses von Fieber befallen und starb im Alter von 59 Jahren. Sein kleiner Sohn As-Salih Ismail al -Malik wurde sein legitimer Erbe und Saladin erklrte sich zu seinem Vasallen, obwohl er eigentlich vorhatte, Syrien und gypten unter seiner eigenen Herrschaft zu vereinen. Er heiratete die Witwe von Nur ad-Din, besiegte die anderen Thronanwrter und bernahm 1185 die Macht in Syrien, womit er schlielich Nur ad-Dins Traum verwirklichte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Laut Wilhelm von Tyrus war Nur ad-Din zwar ein mchtiger Verfolger des christlichen Namens und Glaubens, aber auch ein gerechter Prinz, tapfer und weise und gem den Traditionen seiner Rasse, ein religiser Mann. Nur ad-Din war nach seiner Krankheit und seiner Pilgerreise besonders religis. Er betrachtete die Kreuzfahrer als Auslnder auf muslimischem Territorium, die nach Outremer gekommen waren, um das Land zu plndern und seine heiligen Sttten zu entweihen. Dennoch war er gegenber den Christen, die neben den Armeniern von Edessa unter seiner Herrschaft lebten, tolerant und empfand groen Respekt vor Kaiser Manuel. [PARAGRAPH:1]Nur ad-Din baute auch Universitten und Moscheen in allen von ihm kontrollierten Stdten. Diese Universitten befassten sich hauptschlich mit der Lehre des Korans und der Hadithe. Nur ad-Din selbst genoss es, sich von Experten aus den Hadithen vorlesen zu lassen, und seine Professoren verliehen ihm sogar ein Diplom in Hadith-Erzhlung. Er lie auch in seinen Stdten kostenlose Krankenhuser errichten und baute an den Straen Karawansereien fr Reisende und Pilger. Er hielt mehrmals in der Woche Gericht, damit die Menschen von ihm Gerechtigkeit gegen seine Generle, Gouverneure oder andere Mitarbeiter verlangen konnten, die ein Verbrechen begangen hatten. In der muslimischen Welt bleibt er eine legendre Figur voller militrischem Mut, Frmmigkeit und Bescheidenheit. Sir Steven Runciman sagte, dass er Gerechtigkeit ber alles liebe.</German>

		<Spanish>[H1]Nur ad-Din Zengi[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emir of Damascus and Aleppo[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] February 1118 - 15 May 1174[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Nur ad-Din was the second son of Imad ad-Din Zengi, the Turkish atabeg of Aleppo and Mosul, who was a devoted enemy of the crusader presence in Syria. After the assassination of his father, Nur ad-Din and his older brother Saif ad-Din Ghazi I divided the kingdom amongst themselves, with Nur ad-Din governing Aleppo and Saif ad-Din Ghazi establishing himself in Mosul. Almost as soon as he began his rule, Nur ad-Din attacked the Principality of Antioch, seizing several castles in the north of Syria, while at the same time he defeated an attempt by Joscelin II to recover the County of Edessa, which had been conquered by Zengi in 1144. [PARAGRAPH:1]It was Nur ad-Din's dream to unite the various Muslim forces between the Euphrates and the Nile to make a common front against the crusaders. In 1149 Nur ad-Din has been recognized as overlord of Mosul, so that the major cities of Mosul and Aleppo were united under one man. In 1154, the emir of Damascus was overthrown, the city was annexed to Zengid territory, and all Syria was unified under the authority of Nur ad-Din, from Edessa in the north to the Hauran in the south. [PARAGRAPH:1]As there was now nothing the crusaders could do in Syria, they were forced to look to the south, and after a series of wars they took Alexandira and Cairo from the weakened Fatimids. Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh, his Kurdish general, to restore order. Shirkuh reclaimed Egypt and was made a vizier, later succeeded by his nephew Saladin. Nur ad-Din believed that he had accomplished his goal of uniting the Muslim states, but Saladin did not wish to be subject to his authority.  [PARAGRAPH:1]When Nur ad-Din was on the verge of invading Egypt in 1174, he was seized by a fever due to complications from a peritonsillar abscess, and died at the age of 59. His young son As-Salih Ismail al-Malik became his legitimate heir, and Saladin declared himself his vassal, although he really planned to unify Syria and Egypt under his own rule. He married Nur ad-Din's widow, defeated the other claimants to the throne and took power in Syria in 1185, finally realizing Nur ad-Din's dream. [PARAGRAPH:1]According to William of Tyre, although Nur ad-Din was "a mighty persecutor of the Christian name and faith," he was also "a just prince, valiant and wise, and according to the traditions of his race, a religious man." Nur ad-Din was especially religious after his illness and his pilgrimage. He considered the crusaders foreigners in Muslim territory, who had come to Outremer  to plunder the land and profane its sacred places. Nevertheless, he was tolerant of the Christians who lived under his authority, aside from the Armenians of Edessa and regarded the Emperor Manuel with deep respect. [PARAGRAPH:1]Nur ad-Din also constructed universities and mosques in all the cities he controlled. These universities were principally concerned with teaching the Qur'an and Hadith. Nur ad-Din himself enjoyed to have specialists read to him from the Hadith, and his professors even awarded him a diploma in Hadith narration. He had free hospitals constructed in his cities as well, and built caravanserais  on the roads for travellers and pilgrims. He held court several times a week so that people could seek justice from him against his generals, governors, or other employees who had committed some crime. In the Muslim world he remains a legendary figure of military courage, piety, and modesty. Sir Steven Runciman said that he loved, above all else, justice.</Spanish>

		<German>[TAB]Die Omanis gehrten zu den ersten Menschen, die den Islam annahmen. Die Bekehrung der Omanis wird blicherweise Amr ibn al-As zugeschrieben, der um 630 n. Chr. vom Propheten Mohammed gesandt wurde, um Jaifar und 'Abd, die damaligen gemeinsamen Herrscher von Oman, einzuladen, den Glauben anzunehmen, in den er schlielich eintrat gelungen. In den frhen Jahren der islamischen Mission spielte Oman eine wichtige Rolle in den Apostasiekriegen, die nach dem Tod Mohammeds stattfanden, und beteiligte sich auch an den groen islamischen Eroberungen zu Lande und zu Wasser im Irak, in Persien und darber hinaus. Seine wichtigste Rolle in dieser Hinsicht war jedoch seine umfangreiche Handels- und Seefahrtsttigkeit in Ostafrika und Asien.[PARAGRAPH:1]Im Jahr 751 grndeten Ibadi-Muslime, ein gemigter Zweig der Kharijiten, ein Imamat im Oman. Trotz Unterbrechungen berlebte das Ibadi-Imamat bis zur Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts. Dennoch wurde Oman von mehreren auslndischen Mchten erobert, da es zwischen 931 und 932 und dann erneut zwischen 933 und 934 von den Qarmaten kontrolliert wurde. Zwischen 967 und 1053 war Oman Teil der Herrschaft der iranischen Buyyiden (Mukramiden) und zwischen 1053 und 1154 war Oman Teil des Groen Seldschukenreiches. Im Jahr 1154 bernahm die indigene Nabhani-Dynastie die Kontrolle ber Oman, und die Nabhani-Knige regierten Oman bis 1470, mit einer Unterbrechung von 37 Jahren zwischen 1406 und 1443.[PARAGRAPH:1]Maskat wurde am 1.

Um das Jahr 1600 wurde die Nabhani-Herrschaft im Oman vorbergehend wiederhergestellt, obwohl dies nur bis 1624 dauerte, als das fnfte Imamat, das auch als Yarubid-Imamat bekannt ist, eingefhrt wurde. Letztere eroberten Maskat 1650 von den Portugiesen zurck, nachdem sie 1508 eine Kolonialprsenz an der Nordostkste Omans errichtet hatten. Die Yarubiden-Dynastie expandierte, erwarb ehemalige portugiesische Kolonien in Ostafrika und beteiligte sich am Sklavenhandel. Im Jahr 1719 fhrte die dynastische Nachfolge zur Ernennung von Saif ibn Sultan II. Seine Kandidatur lste eine Rivalitt unter den Ulama und einen Brgerkrieg zwischen den beiden groen Stmmen, den Hinawi und den Ghafiri, aus, wobei die Ghafiri Saif ibn Sultan II. untersttzten. Er bernahm 1748 die Macht, nachdem die Anfhrer beider Fraktionen im Kampf gettet worden waren, aber die Rivalitt ging weiter, wobei die Fraktionierung zugunsten der Iraner wirkte, die Maskat und Suhar bis 1792 besetzten, als die Omanis revoltierten und ihre Stdte unter Sultan Al-Said zurckeroberten.</German>

Zwischen dem 12. Jahrhundert v. Chr. und dem 6. Jahrhundert n. Chr. wurde es von sechs aufeinanderfolgenden Zivilisationen dominiert, die miteinander konkurrierten oder miteinander verbndet waren und den lukrativen Gewrzhandel kontrollierten: M'ain, Qataban, Hadhramaut, Awsan, Saba und Himyarite. [PARAGRAPH:1]Der Islam kam um 630 n. Chr., zu Lebzeiten des islamischen Propheten Mohammed, in den Jemen. Danach wurde Jemen als Teil arabisch-islamischer Kalifate regiert und Jemen wurde eine Provinz im islamischen Reich. Jemenitische Textilien, die seit langem fr ihre hervorragende Qualitt bekannt sind, behielten ihren Ruf und wurden zur Verwendung durch die abbasidische Elite, einschlielich der Kalifen selbst, exportiert. Die Produkte von Sana'a und Aden sind im Ost-West-Textilhandel besonders wichtig.[PARAGRAPH:1]Der ehemalige Nordjemen geriet unter die Kontrolle von Imamen verschiedener Dynastien, meist der Zaidi-Sekte, die eine theokratische politische Struktur errichteten, die berlebte bis in die Neuzeit. Im Jahr 897 grndete ein Zaidi-Herrscher, Yahya al-Hadi ila'l Haqq, eine Linie von Imamen, deren schiitische Dynastie bis in die zweite Hlfte des 20. Jahrhunderts berlebte. Dennoch ist die mittelalterliche Geschichte Jemens eine verworrene Chronik konkurrierender lokaler Imame. Die Fatimiden gyptens halfen den Ismailiten im 11. Jahrhundert, ihre Vorherrschaft zu behaupten. Saladin annektierte den Jemen im Jahr 1173. Die Rasuliden-Dynastie (trkischer Herkunft) regierte den Jemen mit Zabid als Hauptstadt von etwa 1230 bis zum 15. Jahrhundert. 1516 annektierten die gyptischen Mamluken den Jemen; Doch im folgenden Jahr ergab sich der Mamluk-Gouverneur den Osmanen und trkische Armeen berrannten anschlieend das Land. Sie wurden vom zaiditischen Imam Qasim dem Groen (reg. 15971620) herausgefordert und um 1630 aus dem Landesinneren vertrieben. Von da an bis zum 19. Jahrhundert behielten die Osmanen nur die Kontrolle ber isolierte Kstengebiete, whrend dies im Hochland im Allgemeinen der Fall war regiert von den Zaidi-Imamen.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]Yemen is one of the oldest centers of civilization in the Near East. Its relatively fertile land and adequate rainfall in a moister climate helped sustain a stable population, a feature recognized by the ancient Greek geographer Ptolemy, who described Yemen as Eudaimon Arabia (better known in its Latin translation, Arabia Felix) meaning "fortunate Arabia" or Happy Arabia. Between the 12th century BCE and the 6th century CE, it was dominated by six successive civilizations which rivaled each other, or were allied with each other and controlled the lucrative spice trade: M'ain, Qataban, Hadhramaut, Awsan, Saba and Himyarite.[PARAGRAPH:1]Islam came to Yemen around 630 CE, during the Islamic prophet Muhammad's lifetime.

The products of Sana'a and Aden are especially important in the East-West textile trade.[PARAGRAPH:1]The former North Yemen came under control of Imams of various dynasties usually of the Zaidi sect, who established a theocratic political structure that survived until modern times. In 897, a Zaidi ruler, Yahya al-Hadi ila'l Haqq, founded a line of Imams, whose Shiite dynasty survived until the second half of the 20th century. Nevertheless, Yemen's medieval history is a tangled chronicle of contesting local Imams. The Fatimids of Egypt helped the Isma'ilis maintain dominance in the 11th century. Saladin annexed Yemen in 1173. The Rasulid dynasty (Turkish in origin) ruled Yemen, with Zabid as its capital, from about 1230 to the 15th century. In 1516, the Mamluks of Egypt annexed Yemen; but in the following year, the Mamluk governor surrendered to the Ottomans, and Turkish armies subsequently overran the country. They were challenged by the Zaidi Imam, Qasim the Great (r.1597-1620), and were expelled from the interior around 1630. From then until the 19th century, the Ottomans retained control only of isolated coastal areas, while the highlands generally were ruled by the Zaidi Imams.</Italian>

		<English>[TAB]The Safavids were one of the most significant ruling dynasties of Iran. They ruled the greatest Iranian empire since the Islamic conquest of Persia and established the Twelver school of Shia Islam as the official religion of their empire, marking one of the most important turning points in the history of Islam. This Shia dynasty was of mixed ancestry (Kurdish, Azerbaijani, Georgian, Greek) and ruled Iran from 1501/1502 to 1722.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Safavid dynasty had its origin in the Safaviyeh Sufi order which was established in the city of Ardabil in the Azerbaijan region of Iran. From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over all of Persia and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the Sassanids to establish a unified Iranian state.[PARAGRAPH:1]Safavids began to expand their religious influence when Persia was ruled by Ak Koyunlu, the White Sheep Turkmen. By this time, the bulk of the Safaviyeh followers were Turkish-speaking clans from Asia Minor and Azerbaijan, and were collectively known as Qizilbash ("Red Heads") because of their distinct red headgear. The Qizilbash were warriors, spiritual followers of Sheikh Haydar (the leader of Safaviyeh), and a source of the Safavid military and political power, up until the end of 16th century, when various Qizilbashi chiefs began warring each other.

		<German>[TAB]Die Safawiden waren eine der bedeutendsten Herrscherdynastien des Iran. Sie regierten das grte iranische Reich seit der islamischen Eroberung Persiens und etablierten die Zwlfer-Schule des schiitischen Islam als offizielle Religion ihres Reiches, was einen der wichtigsten Wendepunkte in der Geschichte des Islam markierte. Diese schiitische Dynastie war gemischter Abstammung (kurdisch, aserbaidschanisch, georgisch, griechisch) und regierte den Iran von 1501/1502 bis 1722.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Safawiden-Dynastie hatte ihren Ursprung im Safaviyeh-Sufi-Orden, der in der Stadt Ardabil gegrndet wurde in der Region Aserbaidschan im Iran. Von ihrem Sttzpunkt in Ardabil aus etablierten die Safawiden die Kontrolle ber ganz Persien und bekrftigten die iranische Identitt der Region. Damit waren sie die erste einheimische Dynastie seit den Sassaniden, die einen einheitlichen iranischen Staat grndete.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Safawiden begannen, ihre Religion auszuweiten Einfluss, als Persien von Ak Koyunlu, den Weihammel-Turkmenen, regiert wurde. Zu dieser Zeit waren die meisten Anhnger der Safaviyeh trkischsprachige Clans aus Kleinasien und Aserbaidschan und wurden aufgrund ihrer aufflligen roten Kopfbedeckung zusammenfassend als Qizilbash (Rotkpfe) bezeichnet. Die Qizilbash waren Krieger, spirituelle Anhnger von Sheikh Haydar (dem Anfhrer von Safaviyeh) und eine Quelle der militrischen und politischen Macht der Safawiden, bis zum Ende des 16.

Um das Problem zu lsen, organisierte Schah Abbas I. die Armee und die Landesverwaltung mit Ghulams (Sklavenkriegern) neu.[PARAGRAPH:1]Abbas I. wurde der erfolgreichste safawidische Herrscher. Er zentralisierte nicht nur die Kontrolle ber das Land und die Armee, sondern erweiterte auch das iranische Territorium um Afghanistan, den Ostirak, Bahrain und Teile des Kaukasus. Abbas I. untersttzte auch den direkten Handel mit Europa, insbesondere mit England und den Niederlanden, die nach persischen Teppichen, Seide und Textilien suchten. [PARAGRAPH:1] Nachfolgende Herrscher waren nicht so kompetent und der Staat verlor langsam an Macht und verlor immer mehr Provinzen an Osmanen, Usbeken und lokale Belutschen- und Paschtunenstmme. Der safawidische Staat brach 1722 zusammen und wurde von afghanischen (paschtunischen) Rebellen besiegt. Der Iran selbst wurde jedoch gerettet, als Nader Schah, ein General der Safawiden-Armee, schlielich die Afghanen vertrieb und sich 1736 als Schah etablierte und damit die Afschariden-Dynastie begrndete.</German>

He reduced the influence of the Qizilbash in the government and the military and reformed the army, enabling him to fight the Ottomans and Uzbeks and reconquer Iran's lost provinces. He also took back land from the Portuguese and the Mughals. Abbas was a great builder and moved his kingdom's capital from Qazvin to Esfahan. In his later years, the shah became suspicious of his own sons and had them killed or blinded.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]The Samani dynasty, also known as the Samanid Empire, or simply Samanids (819-999) was a Persian state and empire in Central Asia and Greater Khorasan. Named after its founder Saman Khuda, who converted to Sunni Islam despite being from Zoroastrian theocratic nobility. It was the first native Persian dynasty in Greater Iran and Central Asia after the collapse of the Sassanid Persian empire caused by the Arab conquest.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Samanids were a Persian state that reigned for 180 years, encompassing a territory which included Khorasan, Ray, Transoxiania, Tabaristan, Kerman, Gorgan, and west of these provinces up to Isfahan. The Samanids were descendants of Bahram Chobin, and thus descended from the House of Mihran, one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran. In governing their territory, the Samanids modeled their state organization after the Abbasids, mirroring the caliph's court and organization. They were rewarded for supporting the Abbasids in Transoxania and Khorasan, and with their established capitals located in Bukhara, Balkh, Samarkand, and Herat, they carved their kingdom after defeating the Saffarids.[PARAGRAPH:1]With their roots stemming from the city of Balkh (then, part of Greater Khorasan) the Samanids promoted the arts, giving rise to the advancement of science and literature, and thus attracted scholars such as Rudaki and Avicenna. While under Samanid control, Bukhara was a rival to Baghdad in its glory. Scholars note that the Samanids revived Persian more than the Buyids and the Saffarids, while continuing to patronize Arabic to a significant degree. Nevertheless, in a famous edict, Samanid authorities declared that "here, in this region, the language is Persian, and the kings of this realm are Persian kings."[PARAGRAPH:1]The Samanids not only revived Persian culture but they also determinedly propagated Sunni Islam. The Samanid state became a staunch patron of Islamic architecture and spread the Islamo-Persian culture deep into the heart of Central Asia. The first complete translation of the Qur'an into Persian occurred during the reign of Samanids in the 9th century. According to historians, through the zealous missionary work of Samanid rulers, as many as 30,000 tents of Turks came to profess Islam and later under the Ghaznavids higher than 55,000. The mass conversion of the Turks to Islam eventually led to a growing influence of the Ghaznavids, who would later rule the region.[PARAGRAPH:1]Another lasting contribution of the Samanids to the history of Islamic art is the pottery known as Samanid Epigraphic Ware: plates, bowls, and pitchers fired in a white slip and decorated only with calligraphy, often elegantly and rhythmically written. The Arabic phrases used in this calligraphy are generally more or less generic well wishes, or Islamic admonitions to good table manners. In 999 their realm was conquered by the Karakhanids.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Die Samani-Dynastie, auch bekannt als Samanidenreich oder einfach Samaniden (819-999), war ein persischer Staat und Reich in Zentralasien und im Groraum Khorasan. Benannt nach seinem Grnder Saman Khuda, der zum sunnitischen Islam konvertierte, obwohl er dem zoroastrischen theokratischen Adel angehrte. Es war die erste einheimische persische Dynastie im Groraum Iran und Zentralasien nach dem Zusammenbruch des sassanidischen Perserreiches durch die arabische Eroberung.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Samaniden waren ein persischer Staat, der 180 Jahre lang regierte und ein Gebiet umfasste, zu dem auch Khorasan gehrte , Ray, Transoxiania, Tabaristan, Kerman, Gorgan und westlich dieser Provinzen bis nach Isfahan. Die Samaniden waren Nachkommen von Bahram Chobin und stammten somit vom Haus Mihran ab, einem der sieben groen Huser Irans. Bei der Verwaltung ihres Territoriums orientierten sich die Samaniden in ihrer Staatsorganisation an den Abbasiden und spiegelten damit den Hof und die Organisation des Kalifen wider. Sie wurden dafr belohnt, dass sie die Abbasiden in Transoxanien und Chorasan untersttzten, und mit ihren etablierten Hauptstdten in Buchara, Balkh, Samarkand und Herat grndeten sie ihr Knigreich, nachdem sie die Saffariden besiegt hatten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mit ihren Wurzeln in der Stadt Balkh (damals Teil des Groraums Khorasan) frderten die Samaniden die Knste, fhrten zum Fortschritt von Wissenschaft und Literatur und zogen so Gelehrte wie Rudaki und Avicenna an. Whrend Buchara unter der Kontrolle der Samaniden stand, war es in seiner Pracht ein Rivale von Bagdad. Wissenschaftler stellen fest, dass die Samaniden das Persische strker wiederbelebten als die Buyiden und Saffariden, whrend sie das Arabische weiterhin in erheblichem Mae bevormundeten. Dennoch erklrten die samanidischen Behrden in einem berhmten Edikt: Hier, in dieser Region, ist die Sprache Persisch, und die Knige dieses Reiches sind persische Knige.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Samaniden haben nicht nur die persische Kultur wiederbelebt, sondern sie auch entschlossen propagierte den sunnitischen Islam. Der samanidische Staat wurde zu einem berzeugten Frderer der islamischen Architektur und verbreitete die islamisch-persische Kultur tief im Herzen Zentralasiens. Die erste vollstndige bersetzung des Korans ins Persische erfolgte whrend der Herrschaft der Samaniden im 9. Jahrhundert. Historikern zufolge kamen durch die eifrige Missionsarbeit der samanidischen Herrscher bis zu 30.000 Zelte von Trken, um sich zum Islam zu bekennen, und spter unter den Ghaznaviden mehr als 55.000. Die Massenkonvertierung der Trken zum Islam fhrte schlielich zu einem wachsenden Einfluss der Ghaznaviden, die spter die Region regierten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ein weiterer bleibender Beitrag der Samaniden zur Geschichte der islamischen Kunst ist die als Samanid Epigraphic Ware bekannte Keramik : Teller, Schsseln und Krge, in einem weien Schlicker gebrannt und nur mit Kalligraphie verziert, oft elegant und rhythmisch geschrieben. Die in dieser Kalligraphie verwendeten arabischen Phrasen sind im Allgemeinen mehr oder weniger allgemeine Glckwnsche oder islamische Ermahnungen zu guten Tischmanieren. Im Jahr 999 wurde ihr Reich von den Karachaniden erobert.</German>

His reign saw the emergence of the Samanids as a powerful force. He was the son of Ahmad ibn Asad and a descendant of Saman Khuda, the founder of the Samanid dynasty who renounced Zoroastrianism and embraced Islam. Ismail is considered the father of the Tajik nation.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ismail was steadily spreading Samanid influence as well as solidifying his control over other areas including Kerman, Sistan and Kabul. He was successful in establishing economic and commercial development and organized a powerful army. It was said that he made his capital Bukhara into one of Islam's most glorious cities, as Ismail attracted scholars, artists, and doctors of law into the region. The first translation of the Qu'ran into Persian was completed during Samanid rule. Sunni theology greatly cultivated during Ismail's reign, as numerous mosques and madrassas were built.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 893, Ismail took the city of Talas, the capital of the Qarluq Turks. It was probably in that same year that he also brought an end to the Ustrushana dynasty. Ismail and other Samanid rulers propagated Islam amongst the inhabitants and as many as 30,000 tents of Turks came to profess Islam. During his reign he subjugated numerous regional states to the east, directly incorporating some within his boundaries and retaining the local rulers of others as vassals. Khwarazm to the north was partitioned; the southern part remained autonomous under its Afrigid rulers, while the northern part was governed by a Samanid official. Another campaign in 903 further secured the Samanid boundaries. These campaigns kept the heart of his state safe from Turkish raids, and allowed Muslim missionaries to expand their activities in the region.[PARAGRAPH:1]Even after his brother Nasr's death, Ismail's rule in Bukhara was not formally recognized by the caliph at that point. As a result, the Saffarid ruler 'Amr-i Laith himself asked the caliph for the investiture of Transoxiana. The caliph, Al-Mu'tadid however sent Ismail a letter urging him to fight Amr-i Laith and the Saffarids whom the caliph considered usurpers. According to the letter, the caliph stated that he prayed for Ismail who the caliph considered as the rightful ruler of Khorasan. The letter had a profound effect on Ismail, as he was determined to oppose the Saffarids.[PARAGRAPH:1]The two sides fought in Balkh, northern Afghanistan during the spring of 900. During battle, Ismail was significantly outnumbered as he came out with 20,000 horsemen against Amr's 70,000 strong cavalry. Ismail's horsemen were ill-equipped with most having wooden stirrups while some had no shields or lances. Amr-i Laith's cavalry on the other hand, were fully equipped with weapons and armor. Despite fierce fighting, Amr was captured as some of his troops switched sides and joined Ismail. Isma'il wished to ransom him to the Saffarids, but they refused, so he sent 'Amr to the caliph, who blamed 'Amr's conduct in the matter and then invested Isma'il with Khorasan, Tabaristan, Ray, and Isfahan.[PARAGRAPH:1]Although Isma'il continued to send gifts to the caliph, as was customary, he neither paid tribute or taxes. For all intents and purposes he was an independent ruler, although he never took any title higher than that of amir.

		<German>[H1]Ismail Samani[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emir von Khorasan[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Regierungszeit:[\BOLD] 892-907[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD ][NEWLINE][TAB]Ismail ibn Ahmad, auch Amir Adil (der gerechte Befehlshaber) genannt, war der samanidische Emir von Transoxiana (892907) und Khorasan (900907). Unter seiner Herrschaft entstanden die Samaniden zu einer mchtigen Macht. Er war der Sohn von Ahmad ibn Asad und ein Nachkomme von Saman Khuda, dem Grnder der Samaniden-Dynastie, der dem Zoroastrismus abschwor und den Islam annahm. Ismail gilt als Vater der tadschikischen Nation.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ismail weitete den samanidischen Einfluss stetig aus und festigte seine Kontrolle ber andere Gebiete, darunter Kerman, Sistan und Kabul. Es gelang ihm, die wirtschaftliche und kommerzielle Entwicklung voranzutreiben und eine mchtige Armee zu organisieren. Es hie, er habe seine Hauptstadt Buchara zu einer der glorreichsten Stdte des Islam gemacht, da Ismail Gelehrte, Knstler und Rechtswissenschaftler in die Region lockte. Die erste bersetzung des Korans ins Persische wurde whrend der Herrschaft der Samaniden fertiggestellt. Die sunnitische Theologie entwickelte sich whrend der Herrschaft Ismails stark, da zahlreiche Moscheen und Medresen gebaut wurden.[PARAGRAPH:1]Im Jahr 893 eroberte Ismail die Stadt Talas, die Hauptstadt der Qarluq-Trken. Vermutlich beendete er im selben Jahr auch die Ustruschanen-Dynastie. Ismail und andere samanidische Herrscher verbreiteten den Islam unter den Einwohnern und bis zu 30.000 Trken kamen, um sich zum Islam zu bekennen. Whrend seiner Herrschaft unterwarf er zahlreiche Regionalstaaten im Osten, gliederte einige direkt in seine Grenzen ein und behielt die lokalen Herrscher anderer als Vasallen. Choresmien im Norden wurde geteilt; Der sdliche Teil blieb unter seinen frostigen Herrschern autonom, whrend der nrdliche Teil von einem samanidischen Beamten regiert wurde. Ein weiterer Feldzug im Jahr 903 sicherte die Grenzen der Samaniden weiter. Diese Kampagnen schtzten das Herz seines Staates vor trkischen berfllen und ermglichten es muslimischen Missionaren, ihre Aktivitten in der Region auszuweiten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Selbst nach dem Tod seines Bruders Nasr wurde Ismails Herrschaft in Buchara zu diesem Zeitpunkt vom Kalifen nicht offiziell anerkannt. Infolgedessen bat der saffaridische Herrscher 'Amr-i Laith selbst den Kalifen um die Investitur Transoxianas. Der Kalif Al-Mu'tadid schickte Ismail jedoch einen Brief, in dem er ihn aufforderte, gegen Amr-i Laith und die Saffariden zu kmpfen, die der Kalif als Usurpatoren betrachtete. Dem Brief zufolge gab der Kalif an, dass er fr Ismail betete, den der Kalif als den rechtmigen Herrscher von Khorasan ansah. Der Brief hatte eine tiefgreifende Wirkung auf Ismail, da er entschlossen war, sich den Saffariden zu widersetzen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die beiden Seiten kmpften im Frhjahr 900 in Balkh, Nordafghanistan. Whrend der Schlacht war Ismail zahlenmig deutlich unterlegen, als er herauskam 20.000 Reiter gegen Amrs 70.000 Mann starke Kavallerie. Ismails Reiter waren schlecht ausgerstet, die meisten hatten hlzerne Steigbgel, whrend einige keine Schilde oder Lanzen hatten. Die Kavallerie von Amr-i Laith hingegen war vollstndig mit Waffen und Rstungen ausgestattet. Trotz heftiger Kmpfe wurde Amr gefangen genommen, als einige seiner Truppen die Seite wechselten und sich Ismail anschlossen. Isma'il wollte ihn von den Saffariden freikaufen, doch diese weigerten sich, und so schickte er 'Amr zum Kalifen, der 'Amrs Verhalten in dieser Angelegenheit beschuldigte und Isma'il dann mit Khorasan, Tabaristan, Ray und Isfahan betraute.[PARAGRAPH :1]Obwohl Ismail dem Kalifen wie blich weiterhin Geschenke schickte, zahlte er weder Tribut noch Steuern. Im Grunde war er ein unabhngiger Herrscher, obwohl er nie einen hheren Titel als den eines Emirs annahm. Nach langer Krankheit starb Ismail im Jahr 907 und wurde von seinem Sohn Ahmad abgelst.</German>

These campaigns kept the heart of his state safe from Turkish raids, and allowed Muslim missionaries to expand their activities in the region.[PARAGRAPH:1]Even after his brother Nasr's death, Ismail's rule in Bukhara was not formally recognized by the caliph at that point. As a result, the Saffarid ruler 'Amr-i Laith himself asked the caliph for the investiture of Transoxiana. The caliph, Al-Mu'tadid however sent Ismail a letter urging him to fight Amr-i Laith and the Saffarids whom the caliph considered usurpers. According to the letter, the caliph stated that he prayed for Ismail who the caliph considered as the rightful ruler of Khorasan. The letter had a profound effect on Ismail, as he was determined to oppose the Saffarids.[PARAGRAPH:1]The two sides fought in Balkh, northern Afghanistan during the spring of 900. During battle, Ismail was significantly outnumbered as he came out with 20,000 horsemen against Amr's 70,000 strong cavalry. Ismail's horsemen were ill-equipped with most having wooden stirrups while some had no shields or lances. Amr-i Laith's cavalry on the other hand, were fully equipped with weapons and armor. Despite fierce fighting, Amr was captured as some of his troops switched sides and joined Ismail. Isma'il wished to ransom him to the Saffarids, but they refused, so he sent 'Amr to the caliph, who blamed 'Amr's conduct in the matter and then invested Isma'il with Khorasan, Tabaristan, Ray, and Isfahan.[PARAGRAPH:1]Although Isma'il continued to send gifts to the caliph, as was customary, he neither paid tribute or taxes. For all intents and purposes he was an independent ruler, although he never took any title higher than that of amir. After a long sickness Isma'il died in 907 and was succeeded by his son Ahmad.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]Ismail Samani[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Amir of Khorasan[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Reigned:[\BOLD] 892-907[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Ismail ibn Ahmad also referred to as, "Amir Adil" (the Just Commander) was the Samanid amir of Transoxiana (892-907) and Khorasan (900-907). His reign saw the emergence of the Samanids as a powerful force. He was the son of Ahmad ibn Asad and a descendant of Saman Khuda, the founder of the Samanid dynasty who renounced Zoroastrianism and embraced Islam. Ismail is considered the father of the Tajik nation.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ismail was steadily spreading Samanid influence as well as solidifying his control over other areas including Kerman, Sistan and Kabul. He was successful in establishing economic and commercial development and organized a powerful army. It was said that he made his capital Bukhara into one of Islam's most glorious cities, as Ismail attracted scholars, artists, and doctors of law into the region. The first translation of the Qu'ran into Persian was completed during Samanid rule. Sunni theology greatly cultivated during Ismail's reign, as numerous mosques and madrassas were built.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 893, Ismail took the city of Talas, the capital of the Qarluq Turks. It was probably in that same year that he also brought an end to the Ustrushana dynasty. Ismail and other Samanid rulers propagated Islam amongst the inhabitants and as many as 30,000 tents of Turks came to profess Islam. During his reign he subjugated numerous regional states to the east, directly incorporating some within his boundaries and retaining the local rulers of others as vassals. Khwarazm to the north was partitioned; the southern part remained autonomous under its Afrigid rulers, while the northern part was governed by a Samanid official. Another campaign in 903 further secured the Samanid boundaries.

The Seljuk dominion was established over the ancient Sassanid domains, in Iran and Iraq, and included Anatolia as well as parts of Central Asia and modern Afghanistan.

		<German>[TAB]Das Groe Seldschukenreich war ein mittelalterliches trkisch-persisches sunnitisch-muslimisches Reich, das aus dem Qynyq-Zweig der Oghuz-Trken entstand, der einst ein riesiges Gebiet kontrollierte, das sich vom Hindukusch bis Ostanatolien und von Zentralasien bis zum Persischen Golf erstreckte. Von ihren Heimatlndern am Aralsee aus drangen die Seldschuken zunchst nach Chorasan und dann auf das persische Festland vor, bevor sie schlielich Ostanatolien eroberten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das Seldschukenreich wurde 1037 von Tugrul Beg nach den Bemhungen des Grnders der Seldschuken-Dynastie gegrndet , Seldschuken-Beg, im ersten Viertel des elften Jahrhunderts. Seldschuken-Begs Vater hatte eine hhere Position im Oghuz-Yabgu-Staat inne und gab sowohl dem Staat als auch der Dynastie seinen Namen. Die Seldschuken vereinten die zersplitterte politische Szene der stlichen islamischen Welt und spielten eine Schlsselrolle im ersten und zweiten Kreuzzug. Die in Kultur und Sprache stark persianisierten Seldschuken spielten auch eine wichtige Rolle bei der Entwicklung der trkisch-persischen Tradition.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die seldschukische Macht befand sich unter Malikshah I. auf ihrem Hhepunkt, und sowohl die Karachaniden als auch die Ghaznaviden mussten dies anerkennen Oberherrschaft der Seldschuken. Die Herrschaft der Seldschuken erstreckte sich ber die alten Sassanidengebiete im Iran und im Irak und umfasste Anatolien sowie Teile Zentralasiens und des modernen Afghanistans. Die seldschukische Herrschaft orientierte sich an der Stammesorganisation der nomadischen Eroberer und hnelte einem Familienbund oder einem Apanage-Staat. Im Rahmen dieser Organisation teilte das fhrende Mitglied der obersten Familie den Familienmitgliedern Teile seiner Domnen als autonome Apanages zu.[PARAGRAPH:1]Als Malikshah I. im Jahr 1092 starb, spaltete sich das Reich, da sein Bruder und seine vier Shne ber die Aufteilung des Reiches untereinander stritten. In Anatolien wurde Malikshah I. von Kilij Arslan I. abgelst, der das Sultanat Rum grndete, und in Syrien von seinem Bruder Tutusch I.. In Persien wurde er von seinem Sohn Mahmud I. abgelst, dessen Herrschaft von seinen anderen drei Brdern Barkiyaruq im Irak, Muhammad, bestritten wurde Ich in Bagdad und Ahmad Sanjar in Khorasan. Trotz mehrerer Versuche, die seldschukischen Reiche wieder zu vereinen, verhinderten die Kreuzzge, dass nachfolgende Herrscher ihr frheres Reich wiedererlangen konnten. Die Atabegs wie Zengids und Artuqids standen nur nominell unter dem seldschukischen Sultan und kontrollierten Syrien im Allgemeinen unabhngig. Als Ahmed Sanjar 1156 starb, spaltete dies das Reich noch weiter und machte die Atabegs praktisch unabhngig.[PARAGRAPH:1]Fr kurze Zeit war Togrul III. der Sultan aller Seldschuken mit Ausnahme Anatoliens. Im Jahr 1194 wurde Togrul jedoch von Takash, dem Schah des Choresm-Reiches, besiegt und die Seldschuken brachen schlielich zusammen. Vom ehemaligen Seldschukenreich blieb nur das Sultanat Rum in Anatolien brig. Als die Dynastie Mitte des 13. Jahrhunderts unterging, fielen die Mongolen in den 1260er Jahren in Anatolien ein und teilten es in kleine Emirate auf, die als anatolische Beyliks bezeichnet wurden. Schlielich wrde einer von ihnen, die Osmanen, an die Macht kommen und den Rest erobern.</German>

Alp Arslan and his uncle Kutalmish both contested this succession.

Anschlieend marschierte er in Armenien und Georgien ein, die er 1064 eroberte. [PARAGRAPH:1]1068 fiel Alp Arslan auf dem Weg nach Syrien in das Byzantinische Reich ein. Nach drei Feldzgen wurden die Trken besiegt und ber den Euphrat vertrieben. Im Jahr 1071 bot Alp Arslan in Manzikert, nrdlich des Vansees, Frieden an. Das Angebot wurde von Kaiser Romanos IV. abgelehnt und die beiden Streitkrfte trafen in der Schlacht von Manzikert aufeinander. Die kumanischen Sldner unter den byzantinischen Streitkrften liefen sofort auf die trkische Seite ber; und als sie dies sahen, ritten die westlichen Sldner davon und beteiligten sich nicht an der Schlacht. Die Byzantiner wurden vllig in die Flucht geschlagen. Kaiser Romanos IV. wurde selbst gefangen genommen und in die Gegenwart von Alp Arslan gefhrt, der ihn grozgig behandelte und ihn, nachdem Friedensbedingungen vereinbart worden waren, mit Geschenken beladen und respektvoll von einer Militrwache begleitet entlie. [PARAGRAPH:1]Alp Arslans Siege vernderten das Gleichgewicht in Nahasien vllig zugunsten der seldschukischen Trken und sunnitischen Muslime. Whrend das Byzantinische Reich noch fast vier Jahrhunderte andauern sollte und die Kreuzzge die Frage noch eine Zeit lang bestreiten wrden, markierte der Sieg bei Manzikert den Beginn des trkischen Vormarsches in Anatolien. Alp Arslans Eroberung Anatoliens von den Byzantinern gilt auch als einer der entscheidenden Vorlufer der Kreuzzge.</German>

He assumed the name of Muhammad bin Da'ud Chaghri when he embraced Islam, and for his military prowess, personal valour, and fighting skills he obtained the surname Alp Arslan, which means "Warrior Lion" in Turkish. [PARAGRAPH:1]He succeeded his father Chagri Begh as governor of Khorasan in 1059. When his uncle Togrul died he was succeeded by Suleiman, Alp Arslan's brother. Alp Arslan and his uncle Kutalmish both contested this succession. Alp Arslan defeated Kutalmish for the throne and succeeded on 27 April 1064 as sultan of Great Seljuk, and thus became sole monarch of Persia from the river Oxus to the Tigris. [PARAGRAPH:1]In consolidating his empire and subduing contending factions he was ably assisted by Nizam ul-Mulk, his vizier, and one of the most eminent statesmen in early Muslim history. With peace and security established in his dominions, he convoked an assembly of the states and declared his son Malik Shah I his heir and successor. With the hope of capturing Caesarea Mazaca, the capital of Cappadocia, he placed himself at the head of the Turkish cavalry, crossed the Euphrates and entered and invaded the city. He then marched into Armenia and Georgia, which he conquered in 1064. [PARAGRAPH:1]In 1068, en route to Syria, Alp Arslan invaded the Byzantine Empire. After three campaigns, the Turks were defeated and driven across the Euphrates. In 1071, while at Manzikert, north of Lake Van, Alp Arslan offered peace. The offer was rejected by Emperor Romanos IV and the two forces met in the Battle of Manzikert. The Cuman mercenaries among the Byzantine forces immediately defected to the Turkish side; and, seeing this, "the Western mercenaries rode off and took no part in the battle." The Byzantines were totally routed. Emperor Romanos IV was himself taken prisoner and conducted into the presence of Alp Arslan, who treated him with generosity, and, terms of peace having been agreed to, dismissed him, loaded with presents and respectfully attended by a military guard. [PARAGRAPH:1]Alp Arslan's victories changed the balance in near Asia completely in favour of the Seljuk Turks and Sunni Muslims. While the Byzantine Empire was to continue for nearly another four centuries, and the Crusades would contest the issue for some time, the victory at Manzikert signalled the beginning of Turkish ascendancy in Anatolia. Alp Arslan's conquest of Anatolia from the Byzantines is also seen as one of the pivotal precursors to the launch of the crusades.</Italian>

		<German>[TAB]Armenien ist seit prhistorischen Zeiten besiedelt und wurde als Standort des biblischen Gartens Eden vorgeschlagen. Armenien liegt im Hochland rund um die biblischen Berge Ararat, auf denen der berlieferung nach die Arche Noah nach der Sintflut ruhte. [PARAGRAPH:1]Um 600 v. Chr. wurde das Knigreich Armenien unter der Orontiden-Dynastie gegrndet, das bis 428 n. Chr. unter mehreren lokalen Dynastien existierte. Das Knigreich erreichte seinen Hhepunkt zwischen 95 und 66 v. Chr. unter Tigranes dem Groen und wurde zu einem der bedeutendsten mchtige Knigreiche seiner Zeit. Im Laufe seiner Geschichte erlebte das Knigreich Armenien Perioden der Unabhngigkeit, die von Perioden der Autonomie unterbrochen wurden, die den zeitgenssischen Imperien unterworfen waren. Armeniens strategische Lage zwischen zwei Kontinenten hat dazu gefhrt, dass viele Vlker, darunter Assyrer, Griechen, Rmer, Byzantiner, Araber, Mongolen, Perser, osmanische Trken und Russen, in das Land eindrangen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Im Jahr 301 wurde Armenien das erste Land in die Welt, das Christentum als offizielle Staatsreligion anzunehmen, whrend in Armenien seit 40 n. Chr. eine Reihe christlicher Gemeinschaften gegrndet wurden. Vor dem Christentum gab es verschiedene heidnische Gemeinschaften, die jedoch durch einen Zustrom christlicher Missionare konvertiert wurden.[PARAGRAPH:1] Nach dem Fall des armenischen Knigreichs im Jahr 428 wurde der grte Teil Armeniens als Marzpanat in das Sassanidenreich eingegliedert. Nach der Marzpanat-Zeit entwickelte sich Armenien zu einem autonomen Frstentum innerhalb des Arabischen Reiches und vereinigte auch zuvor vom Byzantinischen Reich eroberte armenische Gebiete wieder. Das Frstentum wurde vom Frsten von Armenien regiert, der vom Kalifen und dem byzantinischen Kaiser anerkannt wurde. Das Frstentum Armenien bestand bis 884, als es seine Unabhngigkeit vom geschwchten Arabischen Reich wiedererlangte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das wiedererstandene armenische Knigreich wurde von der Bagratuni-Dynastie regiert und bestand bis 1045. Mit der Zeit trennten sich mehrere Gebiete des Bagratiden-Armeniens als unabhngige Knigreiche und Frstentmer wie das Knigreich Vaspurakan, das vom Haus Artsruni regiert wird, whrend es immer noch die Vormachtstellung der bagratidischen Knige anerkennt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Im Jahr 1045 eroberte das Byzantinische Reich das bagratidische Armenien. Bald fielen auch die anderen armenischen Staaten unter byzantinische Kontrolle. Die byzantinische Herrschaft war nur von kurzer Dauer, denn 1071 besiegten seldschukische Trken die Byzantiner und eroberten Armenien in der Schlacht von Manzikert, wodurch das Seldschukenreich gegrndet wurde. Um dem Tod oder der Knechtschaft durch diejenigen zu entgehen, die seinen Verwandten, Gagik II., Knig von Ani, ermordet hatten, begab sich ein Armenier namens Roupen mit einigen seiner Landsleute in die Schluchten des Taurusgebirges und dann nach Tarsus in Kilikien. Hier gewhrte ihnen der byzantinische Gouverneur des Ortes Schutz, wo schlielich das armenische Knigreich Kilikien gegrndet wurde.[PARAGRAPH:1]In den 1230er Jahren eroberten die mongolischen Ilchane das Frstentum Zakaryan sowie den Rest Armeniens. Den mongolischen Invasionen folgten bald die Invasionen anderer zentralasiatischer Stmme, die vom 12. bis 14. Jahrhundert andauerten. Nach unaufhrlichen Invasionen, von denen jede dem Land Zerstrung brachte, wurde Armenien mit der Zeit geschwcht. Im 16.

Here the Byzantine governor of the place gave them shelter where the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia was eventually established.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1230s Mongol Ilkhanate conquered the Zakaryan Principality, as well as the rest of Armenia. The Mongolian invasions were soon followed by those of other Central Asian tribes, which continued from 1200s till 1400s. After incessant invasions, each bringing destruction to the country, Armenia in time became weakened. In 1500s, the Ottoman Empire and Safavid Persia divided Armenia among themselves.</Spanish>

Im Jahr 1200 starb Tekish und wurde von seinem Sohn Ala ad-Din Muhammad abgelst, der 1205 die restlichen Teile des Groen Seldschukenreiches eroberte und sich selbst zum Schah erklrte. Er wurde schlielich als Choresmshah bekannt. Im Jahr 1212 besiegte er den Gur-Khan Kutluk und eroberte die Lnder der Kara-Khitai, die nun ein Gebiet vom Syr Darya fast bis nach Bagdad und vom Indus bis zum Kaspischen Meer beherrschten.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1218 sandte Dschingis Khan eine Handelsmission in den Staat, doch in der Stadt Otrar beschlagnahmte der Gouverneur deren Gter und lie sie hinrichten, weil er die Botschafter des Khans fr Spione hielt. Dschingis Khan forderte Wiedergutmachung, die der Schah jedoch ablehnte. Dschingis revanchierte sich mit einer Streitmacht von 200.000 Mann und startete eine vielschichtige Invasion. Im Februar 1220 berquerte die mongolische Armee den Syr Darya und begann damit die mongolische Invasion in Zentralasien. Die Mongolen strmten Buchara, Samarkand und die Choresm-Hauptstadt Urgentsch.

Als er nach Persien zurckkehrte, stellte er eine Armee zusammen und grndete ein neues Knigreich. Er konnte seine Macht jedoch nie festigen und verbrachte den Rest seiner Tage damit, gegen die Mongolen, die seldschukischen Trken von Rum und Anwrter auf seinen eigenen Thron zu kmpfen. Nachdem er Persien an die Mongolen verloren hatte, floh er in den Kaukasus, eroberte Aserbaidschan und Teile Georgiens. Anschlieend kmpfte er gegen die Ayyubiden um Armenien und wurde 1230 besiegt. Er floh erneut nach Diyarbakir, wurde jedoch von einem von den Seldschuken angeheuerten Attentter ermordet berlebte, indem er als Sldner im Nordirak arbeitete.

Kairo wurde nach einem Plan von al-Muiz erbaut und entwickelte sich zu einem literarischen Zentrum mit der groen al-Azhar-Moschee, einer Universitt und Bibliotheken.[PARAGRAPH:1]Da gypten unter ihrer Kontrolle war, konnten die Fatimiden kommerziell mit Bagdad konkurrieren. Sie entwickelten die Route ber das Rote Meer als Alternative zur Route ber den Persischen Golf fr den Handel mit Asien. Sie dehnten ihr Territorium auch nach Norden nach Palstina und nach Sdosten bis zu den heiligen Stdten Mekka und Medina aus und schickten Missionare weiter ins Ausland, um bei der Verbreitung des schiitischen Islam zu helfen. Sie vernachlssigten jedoch ihre ursprngliche Machtbasis in Tunesien und verloren die Kontrolle darber an unabhngige Dynastien.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kairo florierte, aber das Fatimiden-Kalifat wurde schwcher und der Groteil der gyptischen Bevlkerung blieb sunnitischer Muslim. Nach dem Zweiten Kreuzzug Mitte des 12. Jahrhunderts kmpften Christen und Muslime um die Kontrolle ber den Reichtum gyptens. Der kurdische General Salah ad-Din (Saladin), der unter syrischer Herrschaft kmpfte, bernahm um diese Zeit die Position des Wesirs in gypten zur Verteidigung gyptens. Er wurde von Muslimen und Christen weithin gelobt. Nach dem Tod des Kalifen al-Adid im Jahr 1171 ersetzte Salah ad-Din das Fatimiden-Kalifat durch sein eigenes Ayyubiden-Sultanat, brachte seine Kurden in Machtpositionen und verbndete gypten erneut mit dem Abbasiden-Kalifat.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]The Fatimids were Arabs who claimed descent from Fatima, daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, and Ali, his son-in-law. They promoted the Shi'a sect of Islam and considered themselves the Prophet's rightful heirs. After establishing a base of power in Tunisia among the Berbers, Ubayd Allah proclaimed himself the first Fatimid caliph in 909 AD. He was theologically opposed to the Abbasid caliph (then in Baghdad), who represented the Sunni sect and most of the Islamic world.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Fatimids needed a commercial base stronger than what Tunisia offered if they were to achieve political success against the Baghdad caliph. They invaded Egypt several times, but it was not until 969 AD that the Fatimids conquered Egypt under their fourth caliph, al-Muiz. To celebrate this victory and to make Egypt their center of power, al-Muiz began the construction of a new capital city close by the Nile. The planet al-Qahir (Mars) was governing the sky at the time, so they named the new city al-Qahirah (Cairo). Cairo was built to a plan made by al-Muiz and it grew to become a literary center featuring the great al-Azhar mosque, university and libraries.[PARAGRAPH:1]With Egypt under their control, the Fatimids could compete commercially with Baghdad. They developed the Red Sea route as an alternative to the Persian Gulf route for trade with Asia. They also expanded their territory north into Palestine and southeast to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and they sent missionaries farther abroad to help spread Shia Islam. However, they neglected their original base of power in Tunisia and lost control of it to independent dynasties.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cairo prospered but the Fatimid Caliphate weakened, and most of the Egyptian population remained Sunni Muslim. After the Second Crusade in the middle of the 12th century, Christians and Muslims fought for control of Egypt's wealth. The Kurdish general Salah ad-Din (Saladin), fighting under Syrian rule, took the position of vizier in Egypt around this time in defense of Egypt. He was widely praised by Muslims and Christians. Salah ad Din replaced the Fatimid Caliphate with his own Ayyubid Sultanate after the death of Caliph al-Adid in 1171, putting fellow Kurds in positions of power and allying Egypt once again with the Abbasid Caliphate.</Italian>

		<English>[TAB]A mamluk was a slave soldier who converted to Islam and served the Muslim caliphs and the Ayyubid sultans during the Middle Ages. Over time, they became a powerful military caste often defeating the Crusaders. On more than one occasion, they seized power for themselves; for example, ruling Egypt in the Mamluk Sultanate from 1250-1517.[PARAGRAPH:1]The first mamluks served the Abbasid caliphs at the end of the 9th century Baghdad. The Mamluk system was an evolution of a previous system, the Ghulam system, invented by the Caliph al-Mu'tasim, in which Turkish prisoners of war became the caliphal guard. This system ended in disaster in the 860s with the murder of four caliphs in a row, and the Mamluk system was created on its ruins. The main difference was that the Mamluks were captured as children and then trained and moulded within the Islamic world to ensure their loyalty to their masters. The Abbasids "recruited" them mainly from areas near the Caucasus (mainly Circassian and Georgian) in later periods, and in the 13th-14th centuries from areas north of the Black Sea (mainly Turkic, most of whom were Kipchak Turks), as well as boys from East Slav populations. Those captured were of non-Muslim origin.[PARAGRAPH:1]After mamluks had converted to Islam, many were trained as cavalry soldiers.

		<French>[TAB]A mamluk was a slave soldier who converted to Islam and served the Muslim caliphs and the Ayyubid sultans during the Middle Ages. Over time, they became a powerful military caste often defeating the Crusaders. On more than one occasion, they seized power for themselves; for example, ruling Egypt in the Mamluk Sultanate from 1250-1517.[PARAGRAPH:1]The first mamluks served the Abbasid caliphs at the end of the 9th century Baghdad. The Mamluk system was an evolution of a previous system, the Ghulam system, invented by the Caliph al-Mu'tasim, in which Turkish prisoners of war became the caliphal guard. This system ended in disaster in the 860s with the murder of four caliphs in a row, and the Mamluk system was created on its ruins. The main difference was that the Mamluks were captured as children and then trained and moulded within the Islamic world to ensure their loyalty to their masters. The Abbasids "recruited" them mainly from areas near the Caucasus (mainly Circassian and Georgian) in later periods, and in the 13th-14th centuries from areas north of the Black Sea (mainly Turkic, most of whom were Kipchak Turks), as well as boys from East Slav populations.

		<German>[TAB]Ein Mamluke war ein Sklavensoldat, der zum Islam konvertierte und im Mittelalter den muslimischen Kalifen und den Ayyubiden-Sultanen diente. Im Laufe der Zeit entwickelten sie sich zu einer mchtigen Militrkaste, die hufig die Kreuzfahrer besiegte. Mehr als einmal ergriffen sie die Macht; Zum Beispiel herrschten sie von 1250 bis 1517 im Mamluken-Sultanat ber gypten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die ersten Mamluken dienten den abbasidischen Kalifen Ende des 9. Jahrhunderts in Bagdad. Das Mamluk-System war eine Weiterentwicklung eines frheren Systems, des Ghulam-Systems, das vom Kalifen al-Mu'tasim erfunden wurde und in dem trkische Kriegsgefangene die Kalifenwache bernahmen. Dieses System endete in den 860er Jahren mit der Ermordung von vier Kalifen in Folge in einer Katastrophe, und auf seinen Ruinen entstand das Mamluk-System. Der Hauptunterschied bestand darin, dass die Mamluken als Kinder gefangen genommen und dann in der islamischen Welt ausgebildet und geformt wurden, um ihre Loyalitt gegenber ihren Herren sicherzustellen. Die Abbasiden "rekrutierten" sie in spteren Perioden hauptschlich aus Gebieten in der Nhe des Kaukasus (hauptschlich Tscherkessen und Georgier) und im 13.-14. Jahrhundert auch aus Gebieten nrdlich des Schwarzen Meeres (hauptschlich Trken, von denen die meisten Kiptschak-Trken waren). als Jungen aus ostslawischen Bevlkerungsgruppen. Die Gefangenen waren nichtmuslimischer Herkunft.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nachdem die Mamluken zum Islam konvertiert waren, wurden viele zu Kavalleriesoldaten ausgebildet. Mamluken mussten den Geboten der Furusiyya folgen, einem Kodex, der Werte wie Mut und Grozgigkeit, aber auch Kavallerietaktiken, Reitkunst, Bogenschieen und Wundbehandlung usw. umfasste.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mamluken lebten in ihren Garnisonen und verbrachten hauptschlich ihre Zeit miteinander. Zu ihren Unterhaltungsmglichkeiten gehrten mindestens zweimal pro Woche Sportveranstaltungen wie Bogenschieen-Wettbewerbe und Vorfhrungen berittener Kampfknste. Die intensive und strenge Ausbildung jedes neuen Rekruten trug dazu bei, die Kontinuitt der Mamluk-Praktiken sicherzustellen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Im Juni 1249 landete der Siebte Kreuzzug unter Ludwig IX. von Frankreich in gypten und eroberte Damietta. Die gyptischen Truppen zogen sich zunchst zurck. Als der gyptische Sultan As-Salih Ayyub starb, ging die Macht kurzzeitig auf seinen Sohn Turanshah und dann auf seine Lieblingsfrau Shajar Al-Durr ber. Mit Untersttzung der Mamluken bernahm sie die Kontrolle und startete einen Gegenangriff. Truppen des Bahri-Kommandanten Baibars besiegten Ludwigs Truppen. Der Knig verzgerte seinen Rckzug zu lange, wurde im Mrz 1250 von den Mamluken gefangen genommen und stimmte einem Lsegeld von 400.000 Livres zu. Politischer Druck fr einen mnnlichen Anfhrer veranlasste Shajar, den Mamluk-Kommandanten Aybak zu heiraten; Spter wurde er in seinem Bad gettet und im darauf folgenden Machtkampf bernahm Vizeregent Qutuz die Macht. Er grndete offiziell das erste mamlukische Sultanat und die Bahri-Dynastie.[PARAGRAPH:1]Als die mongolischen Truppen von Hulagu Khan 1258 Bagdad plnderten und nach Syrien vordrangen, verlie der mamlukische Emir Baibars Damaskus und ging nach Kairo, wo er von Sultan Qutuz begrt wurde. Nach der Einnahme von Damaskus verlangte Hulagu von Qutuz die bergabe gyptens, doch Qutuz lie Hulegus Gesandte tten und mobilisierte mit Baibars' Hilfe seine Truppen. Obwohl Hulegu in den Osten aufbrechen musste, als der groe Khan Mngke im Kampf gegen die Southern Song starb, berlie er seinem Leutnant, dem Christen Kitbuqa, die Fhrung. Qutuz zog die mongolische Armee in einen Hinterhalt in der Nhe des Orontes-Flusses, schlug sie in der Schlacht von Ain Jalut in die Flucht und eroberte und hingerichtete Kitbuqa.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nach diesem groen Triumph wurde Qutuz von verschworenen Mamluken ermordet. Es hie, Baibars, der die Macht bernommen hatte, sei an dem Attentat beteiligt gewesen. In den folgenden Jahrhunderten wurde die Macht oft auf diese Weise bertragen: Die durchschnittliche Regierungszeit eines mamlukischen Herrschers betrug sieben Jahre.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Mamluken besiegten die Mongolen 1260 in Homs ein zweites Mal und begannen, sie nach Osten zurckzudrngen. Dabei festigten sie ihre Macht ber Syrien, befestigten das Gebiet, richteten Postwege ein und stellten diplomatische Verbindungen zwischen den rtlichen Frsten her. Baibars' Truppen griffen 1263 Acre an, eroberten 1265 Caesaria und massakrierten 1268 die Einwohner von Antiochia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das Mamluken-Sultanat berlebte bis 1517, als es vom Osmanischen Reich erobert wurde. Die Institution der Mamluken blieb unter den Osmanen bestehen, wenn auch nicht in der gleichen Form wie unter dem Sultanat.</German>

		<English>[TAB]The province of Sindh and the people inhabiting the region had been designated after the river known in as the Sindhus (Indus) River. Home to the ancient Indus Valley Civilization, in the Middle Ages it saw the arrival of Islam, becoming the easternmost province of the Umayyad, and later Abbasid Caliphate. The Umayyad conqueror, Muhammad bin Qasim, built the city of Mansura as his capital. At the port city of Daybul most of the Bawarij embraced Islam and become known as Sindhi Sailors; they became famous for their skills in navigation, geography and languages. In fact, they inspired the One Thousand and One Nights character Sindbad the Sailor.[PARAGRAPH:1]Direct Arab rule ended in 998 with the ascension of the local Soomra Dynasty, and they were the first local Sindhi Muslims to translate the Quran into the Sindhi language. The Soomros controlled Sindh directly as vassals the Abbasids from 1026 to 1351. [PARAGRAPH:1]The Soomros were one of the first Sindhi tribes to convert to Islam and they were known to the Arabs as the Al-Sumrah. They were taught Cavalry skills by the Arabs, and were renowned masters at riding the Arabian Horse and Camel, they created a network in Sindh which eventually facilitated their rule centered at Mansura.

Als Heimat der alten Indus-Tal-Zivilisation erlebte sie im Mittelalter die Ankunft des Islam und wurde zur stlichsten Provinz der Umayyaden und spter zum Abbasiden-Kalifat. Der Eroberer der Umayyaden, Muhammad bin Qasim, baute die Stadt Mansura als seine Hauptstadt. In der Hafenstadt Daybul konvertierten die meisten Bawarij zum Islam und wurden als Sindhi-Seeleute bekannt; Sie wurden berhmt fr ihre Fhigkeiten in Navigation, Geographie und Sprachen.

		<English>[TAB]During the Delhi Sultanate, several Turkic and Afghan dynasties ruled from Delhi, including the Mamluk dynasty (1206-90), the Khilji dynasty (1290-1320), the Tughlaq dynasty (1320-1413), the Sayyid dynasty (1414-51), and the Lodi dynasty (1451-1526). [PARAGRAPH:1]The sultanate started when Qutb-ud-din Aibak, a slave appointed as the governor of Delhi by Muhammad Ghori, started an independent rule after the death of his master. Aibak began the construction of Qutub Minar, which was completed by Iltutmish, his successor and son-in-law.  [PARAGRAPH:1]For most of its history, the Delhi Sultanate stretched over all of Northern Hindustan. At its greatest extent, under the Tughlaqs controlled all of the subcontinent except Tamil Nadu and some areas in Rajputana. Perhaps the greatest contribution of the Sultanate was its temporary success in insulating the subcontinent from the potential devastation of the Mongol invasion from Central Asia in the thirteenth century. However, the invasion of Tamerlane in 1398 significantly weakened the Delhi Sultanate.

[PARAGRAPH:1]Das Sultanat begann, als Qutb-ud-din Aibak, ein von Muhammad Ghori zum Gouverneur von Delhi ernannter Sklave, nach dem Tod seines Herrn eine unabhngige Herrschaft begann. Aibak begann mit dem Bau von Qutb Minar, der von Iltutmish, seinem Nachfolger und Schwiegersohn, fertiggestellt wurde. [PARAGRAPH:1]Whrend des grten Teils seiner Geschichte erstreckte sich das Sultanat Delhi ber ganz Nord-Hindustan. In ihrer grten Ausdehnung kontrollierten die Tughlaqs den gesamten Subkontinent mit Ausnahme von Tamil Nadu und einigen Gebieten in Rajputana. Der vielleicht grte Beitrag des Sultanats war sein vorbergehender Erfolg, den Subkontinent vor der mglichen Verwstung der mongolischen Invasion aus Zentralasien im 13. Jahrhundert zu schtzen. Die Invasion von Timur im Jahr 1398 schwchte das Sultanat Delhi jedoch erheblich. [PARAGRAPH:1]Das Sultanat erwachte unter den Lodis kurzzeitig wieder zum Leben, aber der letzte Lodi-Herrscher, Ibrahim Lodi, war bei seinem Hof und seinen Untertanen uerst unbeliebt. Nach dem Tod seines Vaters Sikander Lodi schlug er einen kurzen Aufstand einiger seiner Adligen nieder, die seinen jngeren Bruder Jalal Khan zum Sultan machen wollten. Nachdem er den Thron durch die Ermordung Jalal Khans bestiegen hatte, gelang es ihm nie wirklich, seine Adligen zu besnftigen. Anschlieend sandten Daulat Khan, der Gouverneur von Punjab, und Alam Khan, sein Onkel, eine Einladung an Babur, den Herrscher von Kabul, in Delhi einzumarschieren. [PARAGRAPH:1]Die erste Schlacht von Panipat (April 1526) wurde zwischen den Streitkrften von Babur und dem Sultanat Delhi ausgetragen. Ibrahim Lodi wurde auf dem Schlachtfeld gettet. Durch berlegene Feldherrschaft, groe Erfahrung in der Kriegsfhrung, effektive Strategie und angemessenen Einsatz der Artillerie gewann Babur die erste Schlacht von Panipat und besetzte anschlieend Agra und Delhi. Die neue Mogul-Dynastie sollte Indien weitere 300 Jahre lang regieren.</German>

Er war trkischer Abstammung aus Zentralasien, der erste Sultan von Delhi und Grnder der Sklavendynastie (auch bekannt als Ghulam-Dynastie) Indiens. [PARAGRAPH:1]Qutbuddin wurde irgendwo in der Gegend geboren, die heute als Afghanistan bekannt ist. Noch als Kind wurde er gefangen genommen und als Sklave verkauft. Er erhielt in vielen Fchern eine gute Ausbildung, sprach flieend Persisch und Arabisch. Auerdem erhielt er eine Ausbildung im Bogenschieen und Reiten. Als sein Herr starb, wurde er an einen Sklavenhndler verkauft und schlielich vom groen General Shahabuddin Muhammad Ghori, dem damaligen Gouverneur von Ghazni, gekauft. [PARAGRAPH:1]Beginnend mit seinem Heimatland Ghori erwies sich Shahabuddin Ghori als herausragende Persnlichkeit der Geschichte und schaffte es, die Kontrolle ber den grten Teil des heutigen Afghanistan, Pakistan und Nordindien zu erlangen. Unter seinem Kommando eroberte Qutbuddin 1193 Delhi nach dem Sieg in den Schlachten von Tarain. Als Gouverneur Nordindiens etablierte Aibak die erste nachweisbare muslimische Verwaltung durch die Erhebung staatlicher Steuern und die Verteilung von Land und Einnahmen an die ihm unterstellten Adligen sowie eine Regierungsfhrung, die auf einer Mischung aus lokal gewhlten Vertretern und ernannten Administratoren basierte. [PARAGRAPH:1]Nach dem Tod von Sultan Ghori im Jahr 1206 gelang es Qutbuddin nach einem kurzen Machtkampf, sich als Herrscher des Knigreichs in Afghanistan, Pakistan und Nordindien zu etablieren; Die zentralasiatischen Besitztmer von Shahabuddin Muhammad waren von keinem Geringeren als dem mongolischen Kriegsherrn Dschingis Khan erobert worden. [PARAGRAPH:1]Anstatt andere Knigreiche anzugreifen, konzentrierte sich Qutbuddin auf die Entwicklung des bestehenden Reiches. Daher gelang es ihm, obwohl seine formelle Amtszeit als Herrscher nur vier Jahre dauerte, das von seinem Vorgnger und Meister Shahabuddin Ghori eingerichtete Verwaltungssystem zu konsolidieren. Qutbuddin regierte sein Reich zunchst von Lahore aus, verlegte die Hauptstadt jedoch spter nach Delhi. er gilt daher als der erste muslimische Herrscher Sdasiens.

		<English>[TAB]The Ghaznavids were a Turko-Persian Muslim dynasty of Turkic mamluk origin which existed from 975 to 1187 and ruled much of Persia, Transoxiana, and the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent. The Ghaznavid state was centered in Ghazni, a city in present Afghanistan. Due to the political and cultural influence of their predecessors - that of the Persian Samanid Empire - the originally Turkic Ghaznavids became thoroughly Persianized.[PARAGRAPH:1]The dynasty was founded by Sebuktigin upon his succession to rule of territories centered around the city of Ghazni from his father-in-law, Alp Tigin, a break-away ex-general of the Samanid sultans. Sebuktigin's son, Sultan Mahmud, expanded the empire in the region that stretched from the Oxus river to the Indus Valley and the Indian Ocean. The Indian kingdoms of Nagarkot, Thanesar, Kannauj, Gwalior, and Ujjain were all conquered and left in the hands of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist kings as vassal states. The later invasions of Mahmud were specifically directed to temple towns as Indian temples were depositories of great wealth and the economic and ideological centers of gravity for the Hindus. Destroying them would destroy the willpower of the Hindus attacking the Empire since Mahmud never kept a permanent presence in the subcontinent.[PARAGRAPH:1]Under the reign of Mas'ud I it experienced major territorial losses. It lost its western territories to the Seljuks in the Battle of Dandanaqan resulting in a restriction of its holdings to what is now Afghanistan, as well as Balochistan and the Punjab. In 1151, Sultan Bahram Shah lost Ghazni to Ala'uddin Hussain of Ghor and the capital was moved to Lahore until its subsequent capture by the Ghorids in 1186.</English>

He was the son of Rukn-uddin Kurt I and a Ghurid princess.[PARAGRAPH:1]Shams-uddin succeeded his father in 1245, and quickly seized Herat. He then submitted as a vassal to the Mongols, who accepted him as a local ruler. The following year he joined the Mongols under Sali Noyan in an invasion of India, and remained there for a time. During his stay in India he met the Sufi Saint Baha-ud-din Zakariya at Multan in 1247-8. Later he visited the newly crowned Mongol ruler Mngke Khan in Mongolia, who gave him much of Greater Khorasan, and possibly land as far as the Indus.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1263-4, after having subdued Sistan, he visited Hulagu Khan, and three years later his successor Abaqa Khan, whom he accompanied on his campaign against Derbent and Baku. He again visited Abaqa Khan, accompanied by Shams-uddin the Sahib Diwan, in 1276-7, but this time the formerly good opinion of Abaqa in respect to him seems to have changed to one of suspicion, which led to his death. He was poisoned in January of 1278, by means of a watermelon given to him while he was in the bath at Tabriz. Abaqa Khan even had his body buried in chains at Jam. He was then succeeded by his son Rukn-uddin Kurt II. </English>

He was a former slave and later son-in-law of Alptigin who actually seized Ghazni in a political fallout for the throne of the Samanids.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sabuktigin grew up in the court circles of Alptigin and was conferred the titles of Amir ul-Umra ("Chief of the Nobles"), and Wakil-e Mutlak ("Representative"). He was then heavily involved in the defence of Ghaznis independence for the next 15 years as Alptigin's his general. Upon Alptigin's death in 975, both Sabuktigin and Alptigin's son Abu Ishaq went to Bokhara to mend fences with the Samanids. Mansur I of Samanid then officially conferred upon Abu Ishaq the governorship of Ghazni and acknowledged Sabuktigin as the heir. Abu Ishaq died soon after in 977 and Sabuktigin succeeded him to the governorship of Ghazni and married Alptigin's daughter.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 977 he marched against Toghan, who had opposed his succession. Toghan fled to Bust, so Sabuktigin marched upon it and captured Kandahar and its surrounding area. This prompted the Shahi prince Jayapala to launch a pre-emptive strike at Ghazni. Despite the Jayapala amassing approximately 100,000 troops for the battle, Sabuktigin was soundly victorious. The battle was fought at Laghman (near Kabul) and the Jayapala was forced to pay a large tribute. He defaulted upon this, imprisoned Sabuktigin's collectors, and assembled an army allied with forces from the kingdoms of Delhi, Ajmer, Kalinjar, and Kannauj which was defeated at the banks of the Neelum. Sabuktigin then annexed Afghanistan and Peshawar, and all land west of the Neelum.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 994 he was involved in aiding Nuh II of the Samanids against internal uprisings and defeated the rebels at Balkh and then to Nishapur, thereby earning for himself the title of Nasir ud-Din ("Hero of the Faith") and for his son Mahmud the title of Governor of Khorasan and Saif ud-Dawlah ("Sword of the State").[PARAGRAPH:1]Sabuktigin had increased upon Alptigin's domains by extending his domain north to Balkh, west to Kandahar and Khorasan, and east to the Indus River; he was eventually recognized by the Caliph in Baghdad as governor of his dominions. </French>

He was the son of Sharaf al-Din Muzaffar, a servant of the Ilkhanids, and on his father's death in 1314 Mubariz inherited his offices.[PARAGRAPH:1]He lived at the court of Ilkhanid ruler ljait until the latter's death. After ljait's death, Mubariz al-Din left for Maibud, and in 1319 he captured Yazd from Hajji Shah ibn Yusuf Shah, thus putting an end to Atabeg rule there. Some time later, the people of Sistan rebelled against the Ilkhanids, and Mubariz al-Din was ordered to subdue the province, which he did. However, the province rebelled again, and Mubariz al-Din was forced to return. He reportedly fought the rebels in 21 battles until the province was finally subdued.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the wake of declining Ilkhanate authority in central Iran following the death of Abu Sa'id, Mubariz al-Din declared independence from the Ilkhanids. In 1339 or 1340 he invaded the province of Kirman and seized it from its Mongol governor, Kutb al-Din ibn Nasir. Kutb al-Din was able to retake the province after receiving aid from the Kartid dynasty of Herat, but Mubariz al-Din permanently gained control of Kirman in late 1340. The city of Bam was besieged and conquered a few years after this.[PARAGRAPH:1]After the conquest of Kirman, Mubariz al-Din became a rival of the neighboring Injuids, who controlled Shiraz and Isfahan. The Injuid Abu Esshaq unsuccessfully besieged Yazd from 1350-1351, after which his fortunes declined rapidly. During the same year, he sent an army to Kirman, which was defeated by Mubariz al-Din. In 1353, Mubariz al-Din captured Shiraz from Abu Esshaq. Abu Esshaq managed to escape to Isfahan, but Mubariz al-Din pursued him, took the city and executed the Injuid ruler. The Muzaffarids were now the strongest power in central Iran, and Shiraz was made their capital. Mubariz al-Din was known as a cruel ruler, however, and in 1358 his son Shah Shuja blinded and imprisoned him. He died in prison in 1363. </English>

		<English>[TAB]The Kara Koyunlu or Qara Qoyunlu, also called the Black Sheep Turkomans, were a Muslim Oghuz Turkic monarchy that ruled over the territory comprising present-day Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, northwestern Iran, eastern Turkey, and northeastern Iraq from about 1374 to 1468. [PARAGRAPH:1]Early in their history, the Kara Koyunlu Turkomans at one point had their capital in Herat in modern-day Afghanistan. They were later vassals of the Jalairid Sultanate in Baghdad and Tabriz from about 1375, when the leader of their preeminent tribe ruled over Mosul. However, they rebelled against the Jalairids, and secured their independence from the dynasty with the conquest of Tabriz by Qara Yusuf. In 1400, Timur defeated the Kara Koyunlu, and Qara Yusuf fled to Egypt, seeking refuge with the Mamluk Sultanate. He gathered an army, and by 1406 had taken back Tabriz. In 1410, the Kara Koyunlu under Qara Yusuf captured Baghdad. The installation of a subsidiary Kara Koyunlu line there hastened the downfall of the Jalairids they had once served.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Shahrukh Mirza of the Timurids died in 1447, the Kara Koyunlu under Jahan Shah annexed portions of Iraq and the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula as well as Timurid-controlled western Iran. Though much territory was gained during his rule, Jahan Shah's reign was troubled by his rebellious sons and the virtually autonomous rulers of Baghdad, whom he expelled in 1464. In 1466, Jahan Shah attempted to take Diyarbakir from the Aq Qoyunlu ("White Sheep Turkomans"), however, this was a catastrophic failure resulting in Jahan Shah's death and the collapse of Kara Koyunlu control of the Middle East. By 1468, at their height under Uzun Hasan (1452-1478), The Ak Koyunlu had defeated the Kara Koyunlu and conquered Iraq, Azerbaijan, and western Iran. </English>

		<English>[TAB]The Muzaffarid dynasty was a Persian dynasty of Arab origin which came to power in Iran following the breakup of the Ilkhanate. At their zenith, they ruled a kingdom comprising Iranian Azerbaijan, Central Persia, and Persian Iraq. [PARAGRAPH:1]The Muzaffarids were originally from Arabia and settled in Khorasan at the beginning of Caliphal rule there. They stayed in Khorasan until the Mongol invasion of that province, at which point they fled to Yazd. Serving under the Il-Khans, they gained prominence when Sharaf al-Din Muzaffar was made governor of Maibud. He was tasked with crushing the robber-bands that were roaming around the country. Sharaf al-Din's son, Mubariz al-Din Muhammad, was brought up at the Il-Khan's court but returned to Maibud upon the death of the Il-Khan ljeit. In around 1319, he overthrew the atabeg of Yazd and was subsequently recognized as governor of the city by the central Il-Khan government. Following this he began fighting against the Neguderis, a Mongol tribal group. He managed to face this crisis with a minimum of loss.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the wake of decling Il-Khan authority in central Iran following the death of Abu Sa'id, Mubariz al-Din continued to carry out his expansionist policy. He first took Kerman, then Shiraz in 1350, and Isfahan in 1354, in the process putting to death the last of the Inju clan which had formerly held the area, Sheikh Abu Ishaq. With the destruction of Injuid authority, the Muzaffarids were the strongest power in central Iran, and Shiraz was made their capital. Mubariz al-Din was known as a cruel ruler, however, and soon afterwards in 1358, his son Shah Shoja blinded and imprisoned him. A temporary reconciliation was reached, but it failed to last and he died, again in prison, in 1363.[PARAGRAPH:1]Shah Shoja proved to be a less tyrannical figure than his father, but he was constantly fighting with his brothers, leading to a long period of instability. Despite this, his lengthy reign saw the kingdom reach the zenith of its power, eventually stretching from Balochistan to Arran. On his deathbed, Shah Shoja wrote a letter to Timur, who was then campaigning in Azerbaijan, in which he pledged his sons' loyalty to the conqueror. However, when Zain Al-Abidin succeeded his father, he quickly ignored the declaration of loyalty. Timur therefore marched into Muzaffarid lands, coming to Isfahan, where the governor gave him control of the city. But a local rebellion killed any goodwill that Timur had, resulting in a slaughter of the populace. Zain Al-Abidin attempted to flee from Shiraz but was imprisoned by his cousin Shah Mansur. When Timur took the city, the various Muzaffarid princes went to Shiraz to declare their loyalty, whereupon Timur restored them to their positions and returned to Transoxiana.[PARAGRAPH:1]Unfortunately, the Muzaffarids soon began to resume their local feuding. Timur took note of these events, and decided in 1392 that a campaign against Shah Mansur was in order. Shah Mansur gained the Sarbadar Muluk as his ally, who was sent to defend Kashan and the Muzaffarid northern front. By March 1393, Timur had advanced down to Shushtar and Dizful, installing a Sarbadar governor there. Shah Mansur fled Shiraz, but then turned around and met Timur's forces. With an army weakened by desertions, he fought bravely but was forced to retreat. Attempting to reach Shiraz, he was captured by forces of prince Shah Rukh and was decapitated. The other Muzaffarid princes then again swore alliegence to Timur. They were received honorably by the conqueror, but on May 22 in Qumisha they were executed. Only Zain al-Abidin and Sultan Shibli survived the purge; they were sent to Samarkand, and the governance of the Muzaffarid provinces was turned over to more trustworthy individuals. </English>

		<English>[TAB]The Kurt dynasty, also known as the Kartids, was a Sunni Muslim dynasty of Tajik origin that ruled over a large part of Khorasan during the 13th and 14th centuries. Ruling from their capital at Herat, they were at first subordinates of Sultan Abul-Fateh Ghiyasuddin Muhammad bin Sam, Sultan of the Ghurid Empire, to whom they were related. Later they ruled as vassal princes within the Mongol Empire, accompanying the Mongols on campaigns in India and the Caucasus. Upon the fragmentation of the Ilkhanate in 1335, Mu'izz-uddin Husayn ibn Ghiyath-uddin worked to expand his principality.[PARAGRAPH:1]Four years after Mu'izz-uddin Husayn ibn Ghiyath-uddin's ascension, the Ilkhan Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan died, after which the Ilkhanate quickly fragmented. Mu'izz-uddin Husayn, for his part, allied with Togha Temr, a claimant to the Ilkhanid throne, and paid tribute to him. Up until his death, Mu'izz-uddin Husayn's main concern was the neighboring Sarbadars, centered in Sabzavar. As the Sarbadars were the enemies of Togha Temr, they considered the Kurts a threat and then invaded. When the Kurts and Sarbadars met at the Battle of Zava on 18 July 1342, disunity within the Sarbadar army allowed the Kurts to emerge victorious. Thereafter, Mu'izz-uddin Husayn undertook several successful campaigns against the Chagatai Mongols to the northeast. During this time, he took a young Timur into his service.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1349, while Togha Temr was still alive, Mu'izz-uddin Husayn stopped paying tribute to him, and ruled as an independent Sultan. Togha Temr's murder in 1353 by the Sarbadars ended that potential threat. Sometime around 1358, however, the Chagatai amir Qazaghan invaded Khurasan and sacked Herat. As he was returning home, Qazaghan was assassinated, allowing Mu'izz-uddin Husayn to reestablish his authority. Another campaign by the Sarbadars against Mu'izz-uddin Husayn in 1362 was aborted due to their internal disunity. Shortly afterwards, the Kurt leader welcomed Shia dervishes fleeing from the Sarbadar ruler Ali-yi Mu'ayyad, who had killed their leader during the aborted campaign. In the meantime, however, relations with Timur became tense when the Kurts launched a raid into his territory. Upon Mu'izz-uddin Husayn's death in 1370, his son Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali inherited most of the Kurt lands, except for Sarakhs and a portion of Quhistan, which Ghiyas-uddin's stepbrother Malik Muhammad ibn Mu'izz-uddin gained.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali, a grandson of Togha Temr through his mother Sultan Khatun, attempted to destabilize the Sarbadars by stirring up refugee dervishes within his country. 'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad countered by conspiring with Malik Muhammad. When Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali attempted to remove Malik Muhammad, 'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad flanked his army and forced him to abort the campaign. The Sarbadars, however, soon suffered a period of internal strife, and Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali took advantage of this by seizing the city of Nishapur around 1375 or 1376. In the meantime, both Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali and Malik Muhammad had asked for the assistance of Timur: the former had sent an embassy to him, while the latter had appeared before Timur in person to request asylum, having been driven out of Sarakhs. Timur responded to Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali by proposing a marriage between his niece Sevinj Qutluq Agha and the Kurt ruler's son Pir Muhammad ibn Ghiyas-uddin, which took place in Samarkand around 1376.[PARAGRAPH:1]Later, Timur invited Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali to a council, so that the latter could submit to him, but when the Kurt attempted to avoid coming by claiming he had to deal with the Shias in Nishapur, Timur decided to invade. He was encouraged by many Khurasanis and the shaikhs of Jam, who had convinced many of the Kurt dignitaries to welcome Timur as the latter neared Herat. The city fell in April 1381; its fortifications were dismantled, theologians and scholars were deported to Timurid territory, a high tribute was enacted, and Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali and his son were carried off to Samarkand. Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali was made Timur's vassal, until he supported a rebellion in 1382 by the maliks of Herat. Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali and his family were executed around 1383, and Timur's son Miran Shah destroyed the revolt. That same year, a new uprising led by a Shaikh Da'ud-i Khitatai in Isfizar was quickly put down. The remaining Kurts were murdered by Miran Shah at a banquet in 1396. The Kurts therefore came to an end, having been the victims of Timur's first Persian campaign. </English>
		<French>[TAB]The Ghaznavids were a Turko-Persian Muslim dynasty of Turkic mamluk origin which existed from 975 to 1187 and ruled much of Persia, Transoxiana, and the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent. The Ghaznavid state was centered in Ghazni, a city in present Afghanistan. Due to the political and cultural influence of their predecessors - that of the Persian Samanid Empire - the originally Turkic Ghaznavids became thoroughly Persianized.[PARAGRAPH:1]The dynasty was founded by Sebuktigin upon his succession to rule of territories centered around the city of Ghazni from his father-in-law, Alp Tigin, a break-away ex-general of the Samanid sultans. Sebuktigin's son, Sultan Mahmud, expanded the empire in the region that stretched from the Oxus river to the Indus Valley and the Indian Ocean. The Indian kingdoms of Nagarkot, Thanesar, Kannauj, Gwalior, and Ujjain were all conquered and left in the hands of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist kings as vassal states. The later invasions of Mahmud were specifically directed to temple towns as Indian temples were depositories of great wealth and the economic and ideological centers of gravity for the Hindus. Destroying them would destroy the willpower of the Hindus attacking the Empire since Mahmud never kept a permanent presence in the subcontinent.[PARAGRAPH:1]Under the reign of Mas'ud I it experienced major territorial losses. It lost its western territories to the Seljuks in the Battle of Dandanaqan resulting in a restriction of its holdings to what is now Afghanistan, as well as Balochistan and the Punjab.

		<English>[TAB]The Ak Koyunlu or Aq Qoyunlu, also called the White Sheep Turkomans, was an Oghuz Turkic tribal federation, that ruled parts of present-day Eastern Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, northern Iraq, and Iran from 1378 to 1508.[PARAGRAPH:1]According to Byzantine chronicles, the Ak Koyunlu were present in eastern Anatolia since at least 1340, and most of their leaders, including the dynasty's founder, Uzun Hassan, married Byzantine princesses.

Ungefhr zu dieser Zeit versuchte das Osmanische Reich jedoch, sich nach Osten auszudehnen, eine ernsthafte Bedrohung, die die Ak Koyunlu zu einem Bndnis mit den Qaramaniden Zentralanatoliens zwang. Bereits 1464 hatte Uzun Hassan einen der strksten Feinde des Osmanischen Reiches, Venedig, um militrische Hilfe gebeten. Doch trotz venezianischer Versprechungen kam diese Hilfe nie an und in der Folge wurde Uzun Hassan 1473 bei Tercan von den Osmanen besiegt. obwohl dies die Ak Koyunlus nicht zerstrte.

He was appointed to be a wali of Kirkuk, and his first recorded appearance was in 1416, when he defeated Qara Osman during a siege of Erzincan.[PARAGRAPH:1]Qara Yusuf's death in 1420 left his sons Ispend bin Yusuf, Iskander, Jahan Shah, and Abu Sa'id fighting over the succession. The Sa'dlu tribe, one of the main sub-tribes of the Kara Koyunlu, declared Ispend as the their new chief. Abu Sa'id had to flee and Jahan Shah went to Baghdad. Iskander was supported by his brother Shah Muhammad, who was governing Baghdad at that time. Iskandar was crowned on 2 July 1421, and soon found himself fighting the Ak Koyunlu who were invading from the west, whom he subsequently defeated. The Timurid Shah Rukh took advantage of the divided state of the Kara Koyunlu and invaded their land, battling the forces of Iskander and Ispend at Yakhsi and eking out a victory after a ruse. He then briefly occupied Azerbaijan and Armenia before withdrawing once more to Khorasan, after which Ispend quickly re-occupied Nakhchivan and Tabriz. However, Iskander followed and fought with him, taking the city and establishing himself as sole ruler of the Kara Koyunlu.[PARAGRAPH:1]He quickly made punitive expeditions against local rulers, firstly defeating and killing Kurdish emir Malik Muhammad. In 1425 the brothers of Shirvanshah Khalilullah I revolted, and Qara Iskander used this as an opportunity to lay waste to and raid the region. Later he made another punitive expedition on Khwaja Yusuf, a governor of Soltaniyeh appointed by Shahrukh in 1428. In 1431 Qara Iskander marched on his rebellious brother Abu Sa'id and killed him. After years of local turmoil and further conflict with the Timurids, in 1436 Shah Rukh once again installed a Timurid governor in Tabriz, this time Qara Iskander's brother Jahan Shah. Iskander marched on Tabriz but was defeated by Jahan Shah at Sufiyan, having been betrayed by some of his emirs. He then fled and took refuge in the castle of Alinja. Jahan Shah besieged the castle, and during the siege Iskander was murdered by his own son. Jahan Shah was coronated in 1438. </English>

		<English>[TAB]The Timurids, were a Persianate Central Asian Sunni Muslim dynasty of originally Turko-Mongol descent whose empire included the whole of Central Asia, Iran, modern Afghanistan, as well as large parts of Pakistan, India, Mesopotamia, Anatolia and the Caucasus. It was founded by the militant conqueror Tamerlane in the 14th century.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tamerlane conquered large parts of Transoxiana and Khorasan from 1363 onwards with various alliances, and was recognized as ruler over them in 1370. Acting officially in the name of the Mongolian Chagatai ulus, he subjugated Transoxania and Khwarazm in the years that followed and began a campaign westwards in 1380. By 1389 he had removed the Kartids from Herat and advanced into mainland Persia from 1382. In 1394/95 he triumphed over the Golden Horde and enforced his sovereignty in the Caucasus, in 1398 subjugated Multan and Dipalpur in modern day Pakistan and in modern day India left Delhi in such ruin that it is said for two months "not a bird moved wing in the city". In 1400/01 conquered Aleppo, Damascus and eastern Anatolia, in 1401 destroyed Baghdad and in 1402 triumphed over the Ottomans at Ankara. An estimated 17 million people may have died from his conquests. Due to the fact that the Persian cities were desolated by previous wars, the seat of Persian culture was now in Samarkand and Herat. These cities became the center of the Timurid renaissance.[PARAGRAPH:1]After the death of Tamerlane, his empire broke into two halves and suffered from constant internal fighting between various members of the dynasty. In 1501-1510, most of the former empire was overrun by the Uzbeks.

Er versuchte, das Mongolenreich wiederherzustellen, doch sein schwerster Schlag richtete er gegen die muslimische Tataren-Goldene Horde. Er fhlte sich eher in einer stdtischen Umgebung zu Hause als in der Steppe. Er bezeichnete sich selbst als Ghazi, doch einige muslimische Staaten, beispielsweise das Osmanische Reich, wurden von seinen Kriegen schwer getroffen. Als groer Frderer der Knste richteten seine Feldzge auch groe Zerstrungen an. Timur sagte den Qadis von Aleppo whrend der Plnderung dieser neu eroberten Stadt: "Ich bin kein Mann von Blut; und Gott ist mein Zeuge, dass ich in all meinen Kriegen nie der Angreifer gewesen bin und dass meine Feinde es immer gewesen sind." Urheber ihres eigenen Unglcks."[PARAGRAPH:1]Timurs militrische Talente waren einzigartig. Er plante alle seine Feldzge Jahre im Voraus und pflanzte sogar zwei Jahre vor seinen Feldzgen Gerste als Pferdefutter an. Als Teil seiner Taktik nutzte er Propaganda, die heute als Informationskrieg bezeichnet wird. Seinen Feldzgen ging der Einsatz von Spionen voraus, zu deren Aufgaben das Sammeln von Informationen und die Verbreitung schrecklicher Berichte ber die Grausamkeit, Gre und Macht von Timurs Armeen gehrte. Eine solche psychologische Kriegsfhrung schwchte schlielich die Moral der bedrohten Bevlkerung und lste Panik in den Regionen aus, in die er einmarschieren wollte.[PARAGRAPH:1] Whrend Timurs (fr die damalige Zeit) untypische Sorge um seine Truppen starke Loyalitt hervorrief, bezahlte er sie nicht. Ihre einzigen Anreize bestanden in der Plnderung eroberter Gebiete - eine Prmie, die Pferde, Frauen, Edelmetalle und Steine beinhaltete; mit anderen Worten, was auch immer sie oder ihre neu gefangenen Sklaven aus den eroberten Lndern mitnehmen konnten.[PARAGRAPH:1] Timurs kurzlebiges Reich vereinte auch die trkisch-persische Tradition in Transoxianien und in den meisten Gebieten, denen er einverleibte In seinem Lehen wurde Persisch zur Hauptsprache der Verwaltung und der literarischen Kultur (Diwan), unabhngig von der ethnischen Zugehrigkeit. Darber hinaus entstanden whrend seiner Herrschaft einige Beitrge zur trkischen Literatur, wodurch der Einfluss der trkischen Kultur zunahm und florierte.

Whrend seiner Herrschaft beseitigte er militrische Bedrohungen durch die mchtigen paschtunischen Nachkommen von Sher Shah Suri und besiegte in der zweiten Schlacht von Panipat den neu selbsternannten Hindu-Knig Hemu. Er brauchte fast zwei weitere Jahrzehnte, um seine Macht zu festigen und Teile Nord- und Zentralindiens in sein Reich zu bringen.

Er frderte nicht nur die Entwicklung der Mogulschule, sondern frderte auch den europischen Malstil. Er liebte Literatur und lie mehrere Sanskrit-Werke ins Persische bersetzen, auerdem lie er viele persische Werke von Malern seines Hofes illustrieren. Akbar begann eine Reihe religiser Debatten, bei denen muslimische Gelehrte religise Fragen mit Sikhs, Hindus, Carvaka-Atheisten, Juden und portugiesischen rmisch-katholischen Jesuiten diskutierten. In den ersten Jahren seiner Herrschaft hatte er eine intolerante Haltung gegenber Hindus und anderen Religionen, doch nachdem er Ehebndnisse mit Rajput-Prinzessinnen geschlossen hatte, zeigte er groe Toleranz. Er grndete einen religisen Kult, den Din-i-Ilahi (Gttlicher Glaube), der jedoch fr Akbar nur eine Form des Personenkults darstellte und sich nach seinem Tod schnell auflste.</German>

		<English>[TAB]The Sultanate of R&#251;m was the continuation of the Great Seljuq Empire in Anatolia, in direct lineage from 1077 to 1307.

Innerhalb Anatoliens frderten die Seldschuken den Handel durch ein Programm zum Bau von Karawansereien (Han), das den Warenfluss aus dem Iran und Zentralasien zu den Hfen erleichterte. In dieser Zeit entstanden besonders starke Handelsbeziehungen mit den Genuesen. Der gestiegene Reichtum ermglichte es dem Sultanat, andere trkische Staaten zu absorbieren, die nach der Schlacht von Manzikert in Ostanatolien gegrndet worden waren: die Danishmends, die Mengcek, die Saltuklu und die Artuklu. Seldschuken-Sultane trugen erfolgreich die Hauptlast der Kreuzzge, erlagen jedoch 1243 den vorrckenden Mongolen. Die Seldschuken wurden zu Vasallen der Mongolen, und trotz der Bemhungen kluger Administratoren, die Integritt des Staates zu bewahren, zerfiel die Macht des Sultanats in der zweiten Hlfte des 13.

Nure Sufi's son, Kerimeddin Karaman Bey, gained a tenuous control over the mountainous parts of Cilicia in the middle of the 13th century.

As a reward for this expansion of Seljuk territory, the sultan Kilij Arslan IV gave the town of Larende (now Karaman in honor of the dynasty) to the Karamanoglu. Despite several blows from the Seljuks and Mongols, Karamanoglu continued to increase their power and influence, largely aided by the Mamluks of Egypt, especially during the reign of Baybars.

Vom 13.

Von dort zog er in das westliche Taurusgebirge, in die Nhe der Stadt Larende, wo er als Holzfller arbeitete. Nure Sufis Sohn, Kerimeddin Karaman Bey, erlangte Mitte des 13. Jahrhunderts eine schwache Kontrolle ber die bergigen Teile Kilikiens. Eine hartnckige, aber falsche Legende besagt jedoch, dass der seldschukische Sultan von Rum, Kayqubad I., stattdessen Karaman in diesen Lndern errichtete. [PARAGRAPH:1]Karaman erweiterte seine Gebiete durch die Eroberung von Burgen in Ermenek, Mut, Eregli, Gulnar, Mer und Silifke. Als Belohnung fr diese Erweiterung des seldschukischen Territoriums schenkte Sultan Kilij Arslan IV. den Karamanoglu die Stadt Larende (heute Karaman zu Ehren der Dynastie). Trotz mehrerer Schlge der Seldschuken und Mongolen baute Karamanoglu seine Macht und seinen Einfluss weiter aus, vor allem mit Untersttzung der Mamluken gyptens, insbesondere whrend der Herrschaft von Baybars. Karamanoglu eroberte Konya zu Beginn des 14. Jahrhunderts zweimal, wurde jedoch beim ersten Mal von Emir Chupan, dem Gouverneur der Ilchaniden fr Anatolien, und beim zweiten Mal von Emir Chupans Sohn und Nachfolger Timurtasch vertrieben. Nach dem Fall der Ilchaniden kam es zu einer Ausweitung der Macht von Karamanoglu. Eine zweite Expansion fiel mit der Heirat von Karamanoglu Alaeddin Ali Bey mit Nefise Sultan, der Tochter des osmanischen Sultans Murad II., zusammen, dem ersten wichtigen Kontakt zwischen den beiden Dynastien.[PARAGRAPH:1]Als die osmanische Macht auf den Balkan expandierte, eroberte Aleaddin Ali Bey die Stadt Beysehir, die eine osmanische Stadt war. Es dauerte jedoch nicht lange, bis die Osmanen reagierten und auf Konya, die Hauptstadt der Karamaniden, marschierten. Es wurde ein Vertrag zwischen den beiden Knigreichen geschlossen und es herrschte Frieden bis zur Herrschaft von Bayezid I.[PARAGRAPH:1]Whrend des Kreuzzugs von Varna gegen die Osmanen 1443-44 marschierte der Karamanid Ibrahim Bey nach Ankara und Ktahya und zerstrte beide Stdte. In der Zwischenzeit kehrte der osmanische Sultan Murad II. mit einem Sieg ber die ungarischen Kreuzfahrer aus Rumelien zurck. Wie alle anderen islamischen Emirate in Anatolien wurde den Karamaniden Hochverrat vorgeworfen. Daher akzeptierte Ibrahim Bey alle osmanischen Bedingungen.

[PARAGRAPH:1]Karaman expanded his territories by capturing castles in Ermenek, Mut, Eregli, Gulnar, Mer and Silifke. As a reward for this expansion of Seljuk territory, the sultan Kilij Arslan IV gave the town of Larende (now Karaman in honor of the dynasty) to the Karamanoglu. Despite several blows from the Seljuks and Mongols, Karamanoglu continued to increase their power and influence, largely aided by the Mamluks of Egypt, especially during the reign of Baybars. Karamanoglu captured Konya on two occasions in the beginning of the 14th century, but were driven out the first time by emir Chupan, the Ilkhanid governor for Anatolia, and the second time by Emir Chupan's son and successor Timurtash. An expansion of Karamanoglu power occurred after the fall of the Ilkhanids. A second expansion coincided with Karamanoglu Alaeddin Ali Bey's marriage to Nefise Sultan, the daughter of the Ottoman sultan Murad II, the first important contact between the two dynasties.[PARAGRAPH:1]As Ottoman power expanded into the Balkans, Aleaddin Ali Bey captured the city of Beysehir, which had been an Ottoman city. However, it did not take much time for the Ottomans to react and march on Konya, the capital city of Karamanids. A treaty between the two kingdoms was made and peace existed until the reign of Bayezid I.[PARAGRAPH:1]During the Crusade of Varna against the Ottomans in 1443-4, Karamanid Ibrahim Bey marched on Ankara and Kutahya, destroying both cities. In the meantime, the Ottoman sultan Murad II was returning from Rumelia with a victory against the Hungarian Crusaders. Like all other Islamic emirates in Anatolia, the Karamanids were accused of treason. Hence, Ibrahim Bey accepted all Ottoman terms. The Karamanid state was eventually terminated by the Ottomans in 1487, as the power of their Egyptian allies was declining.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]The Kingdom of Jerusalem was a Christian kingdom established in the Levant in 1099 after the First Crusade. It lasted nearly two hundred years, from 1099 until 1291 when the last remaining possession, Acre, was destroyed by the Mamluks.[PARAGRAPH:1]At first the kingdom was little more than a loose collection of towns and cities captured during the crusade. Later kings expanded its size so that at its height in the mid-12th century, the kingdom roughly encompassed the territory of modern-day Israel, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories. It extended from Lebanon in the north to the Sinai Desert in the south, and into modern Jordan and Syria in the east. There were attempts to expand the kingdom into Fatimid Egypt. Its kings held a certain amount of authority over the other crusader states: Tripoli, Antioch, and Edessa.[PARAGRAPH:1]Many customs and institutions were imported from the crusaders' original homelands in Western Europe, and there were close familial and political connections with the West throughout the kingdom's existence. As a relatively minor kingdom it often lacked financial and military support from Europe. The kingdom had closer ties to the neighbouring Kingdom of Armenia and the Byzantine Empire, from which it inherited oriental qualities, as well as being influenced by pre-existing Eastern institutions. Socially, the Frankish inhabitants were dominant and the Muslims and eastern Christians were a marginalized lower class.[PARAGRAPH:1]At first the Muslim world held little concern for the fledgling kingdom, but as the 12th century progressed, the kingdom's Muslim neighbours were united by Nur ad-Din Zangi and Saladin, who vigorously began to recapture lost territory. Jerusalem itself was lost to Saladin in 1187, and by the 13th century the Kingdom was reduced to a few cities along the Mediterranean coast. In this period, the kingdom, sometimes referred to as the "Kingdom of Acre", was ruled by the Lusignan dynasty of the crusader Kingdom of Cyprus, and ties were strengthened with Tripoli, Antioch, and Armenia. The kingdom was soon increasingly dominated by the Italian city-states of Venice and Genoa, as well as the imperial ambitions of the Holy Roman Emperors. The kingdom became little more than a pawn in the politics and warfare of the Ayyubid and Mamluk dynasties in Egypt, as well as the Khwarezmian and Mongol invaders.

		<German>[TAB]Das Knigreich Jerusalem war ein christliches Knigreich, das 1099 nach dem Ersten Kreuzzug in der Levante gegrndet wurde. Es dauerte fast zweihundert Jahre, von 1099 bis 1291, als der letzte verbleibende Besitz, Acre, von den Mamluken zerstrt wurde.[PARAGRAPH:1]Zuerst war das Knigreich kaum mehr als eine lose Ansammlung von Stdten, die whrend des Kreuzzugs erobert wurden. Sptere Knige erweiterten seine Gre, so dass das Knigreich auf seinem Hhepunkt in der Mitte des 12. Jahrhunderts ungefhr das Gebiet des heutigen Israel, des Libanon und der palstinensischen Gebiete umfasste. Es erstreckte sich vom Libanon im Norden bis zur Sinai-Wste im Sden und bis in das heutige Jordanien und Syrien im Osten. Es gab Versuche, das Knigreich nach dem fatimidischen gypten auszudehnen. Seine Knige hatten ein gewisses Ma an Autoritt ber die anderen Kreuzfahrerstaaten: Tripolis, Antiochia und Edessa.[PARAGRAPH:1]Viele Bruche und Institutionen wurden aus den ursprnglichen Heimatlndern der Kreuzfahrer in Westeuropa importiert, und es gab enge familire und politische Verbindungen mit dem Westen whrend der gesamten Existenz des Knigreichs. Als relativ kleines Knigreich fehlte es oft an finanzieller und militrischer Untersttzung aus Europa. Das Knigreich hatte engere Beziehungen zum benachbarten Knigreich Armenien und zum Byzantinischen Reich, von denen es orientalische Qualitten erbte und von bereits bestehenden stlichen Institutionen beeinflusst wurde. Gesellschaftlich dominierten die frnkischen Einwohner und die Muslime und stlichen Christen bildeten eine marginalisierte Unterschicht.[PARAGRAPH:1]Zuerst kmmerte sich die muslimische Welt wenig um das junge Knigreich, aber im Laufe des 12. Jahrhunderts vereinten sich die muslimischen Nachbarn des Knigreichs von Nur ad-Din Zangi und Saladin, die energisch damit begannen, verlorenes Territorium zurckzuerobern. Jerusalem selbst ging 1187 an Saladin verloren und im 13. Jahrhundert wurde das Knigreich auf wenige Stdte entlang der Mittelmeerkste reduziert. In dieser Zeit wurde das Knigreich, das manchmal auch als "Knigreich Akko" bezeichnet wird, von der Lusignan-Dynastie des Kreuzfahrerknigreichs Zypern regiert, und die Beziehungen zu Tripolis, Antiochia und Armenien wurden gestrkt. Das Knigreich wurde bald zunehmend von den italienischen Stadtstaaten Venedig und Genua sowie den imperialen Ambitionen der Kaiser des Heiligen Rmischen Reiches dominiert. Das Knigreich wurde kaum mehr als eine Schachfigur in der Politik und Kriegsfhrung der Ayyubiden- und Mamluken-Dynastien in gypten sowie der Khwarezm- und Mongolen-Invasoren. Die Mamluk-Sultane Baibars und al-Ashraf Khalil eroberten schlielich alle verbliebenen Kreuzfahrerhochburgen zurck, was 1291 in der Zerstrung von Acre gipfelte.</German>

He was the brother of Godfrey of Bouillon, who was the first ruler of the crusader state of Jerusalem, although he refused the title of 'king' which Baldwin accepted. [PARAGRAPH:1]Baldwin joined the First Crusade in 1096 with his brothers Godfrey and Eustace III of Boulogne, selling much of his property to the church in order to pay for his expenses. Baldwin accompanied his brothers as far as Heraclea in Asia Minor, where he broke away from the main body of the crusaders to march into Cilicia. He briefly occupied Tarsus and Turbessel, then was adopted by Thoros of Edessa, becoming Thoros' son and successor. When Thoros was assassinated in March of 1098, Baldwin became the first count of Edessa, although it is unknown if he played any role in the assassination. He ruled the county until 1100, marrying Arda, the daughter of Thoros, and acted as an ambassador between the crusaders and Armenians. [PARAGRAPH:1]After the death of Baldwin's brother Godfrey in 1100, he was crowned the first king of Jerusalem and quickly began  expanding his territory. In 1101 he captured Arsuf and Caesarea, with assistance from a Genoese fleet. In return the Genoese were granted trading quarters in these towns, and an archbishopric was established in Caesarea. In 1103 Baldwin besieged Acre, without success as it was relieved by an Egyptian fleet. In 1104 however Baldwin was assisted by a Genoese fleet and Acre was captured. In 1105 another battle was fought at Ramlah and Baldwin was victorious here as well. In 1110 Beirut was added to the territory of Jerusalem, again with help from the Genoese. [PARAGRAPH:1]In 1113 Baldwin faced a large invasion by the combined forces of Toghtekin of Damascus and Aksunk-ur of Mosul, and though the kingdom was on the brink of destruction Baldwin was assisted by troops from Antioch and new arrivals of European pilgrims at the Battle of Al-Sannabra. In 1113 he also married Adelaide del Vasto; he had abandoned his Armenian wife Arda in 1108, on the pretext that she had been unfaithful, or, according to Guibert of Nogent, because she had been raped by pirates on the way to Jerusalem. It is more likely however that she was simply politically useless in Jerusalem, which had no Armenian population. Technically the marriage to Adelaide was bigamous because Arda was still alive in a monastery in Jerusalem, and it would later cause many problems both for Baldwin and Patriarch Arnulf, who had sanctioned it. [PARAGRAPH:1]In 1115 he led an expedition into Transjordan and built the castle of Montreal. The Syrian Christians who lived in the area were invited to settle in Jerusalem to replenish the population, which had been mostly massacred in 1099. In 1117 he built the castle of Scandalion near Tyre, which was still in Muslim hands. At this point the army in the Kingdom of Jerusalem consisted of only 6,000 men, including 1,000 knights but it was augmented with 5,000 turcopoles. [PARAGRAPH:1]In 1117 Baldwin fell ill. He was convinced that the sickness was due to his bigamous marriage to Adelaide, and in response Adelaide was sent back to Sicily, much to her disgust. Baldwin recovered, however, and in 1118 he marched into Egypt and plundered Farama. Then he fell ill again and died on the way back to Jerusalem. Fulcher of Chartres says "The Franks wept, the Syrians, and even the Saracens who saw it grieved also." His cousin Baldwin of Bourcq was chosen as his successor, although the kingdom was also offered to Eustace III, who did not want it.</English>

		<German>[H1]Baldwin I. von Jerusalem[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Graf von Edessa und Knig von Jerusalem[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] ca. 1058 - 2. April 1118[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Baldwin war einer der Anfhrer des Ersten Kreuzzugs, der der erste Graf von Edessa und dann der zweite und erste Herrscher wurde mit dem Titel "Knig von Jerusalem". Er war der Bruder von Gottfried von Bouillon, dem ersten Herrscher des Kreuzfahrerstaates Jerusalem, obwohl er den Titel "Knig" ablehnte, den Baldwin akzeptierte. [PARAGRAPH:1]Baldwin schloss sich 1096 mit seinen Brdern Godfrey und Eustace III von Boulogne dem Ersten Kreuzzug an und verkaufte einen Groteil seines Eigentums an die Kirche, um seine Ausgaben zu bezahlen. Balduin begleitete seine Brder bis nach Herakleia in Kleinasien, wo er sich von der Hauptmacht der Kreuzfahrer lste, um nach Kilikien zu marschieren. Er besetzte kurzzeitig Tarsus und Turbessel, wurde dann von Thoros von Edessa adoptiert und wurde Thoros' Sohn und Nachfolger. Als Thoros im Mrz 1098 ermordet wurde, wurde Balduin der erste Graf von Edessa, obwohl nicht bekannt ist, ob er bei dem Attentat eine Rolle spielte. Er regierte die Grafschaft bis 1100, heiratete Arda, die Tochter von Thoros, und fungierte als Botschafter zwischen den Kreuzfahrern und den Armeniern. [PARAGRAPH:1]Nach dem Tod von Baldwins Bruder Godfrey im Jahr 1100 wurde er zum ersten Knig von Jerusalem gekrnt und begann schnell, sein Territorium zu erweitern. Im Jahr 1101 eroberte er mit Untersttzung einer genuesischen Flotte Arsuf und Csarea. Im Gegenzug erhielten die Genueser Handelsquartiere in diesen Stdten und in Csarea wurde ein Erzbistum errichtet. Im Jahr 1103 belagerte Balduin Acre erfolglos, da es von einer gyptischen Flotte abgelst wurde. Im Jahr 1104 wurde Balduin jedoch von einer genuesischen Flotte untersttzt und Acre wurde erobert. Im Jahr 1105 kam es zu einer weiteren Schlacht bei Ramlah und Balduin siegte auch hier. Im Jahr 1110 wurde Beirut, wiederum mit Hilfe der Genueser, dem Gebiet Jerusalems angegliedert. [PARAGRAPH:1]Im Jahr 1113 sah sich Balduin einer groen Invasion durch die vereinten Streitkrfte von Toghtekin von Damaskus und Aksunk-ur von Mossul gegenber, und obwohl das Knigreich am Rande der Zerstrung stand, wurde Balduin von Truppen aus Antiochia und Neuankmmlingen europischer Pilger untersttzt in der Schlacht von Al-Sannabra. Im Jahr 1113 heiratete er auch Adelaide del Vasto; Er hatte seine armenische Frau Arda 1108 unter dem Vorwand verlassen, sie sei untreu gewesen, oder, laut Guibert von Nogent, weil sie auf dem Weg nach Jerusalem von Piraten vergewaltigt worden sei. Es ist jedoch wahrscheinlicher, dass sie in Jerusalem, wo es keine armenische Bevlkerung gab, einfach politisch nutzlos war. Technisch gesehen war die Ehe mit Adelaide bigam, da Arda noch in einem Kloster in Jerusalem lebte, und sie wrde spter sowohl fr Balduin als auch fr Patriarch Arnulf, der sie genehmigt hatte, viele Probleme bereiten. [PARAGRAPH:1]Im Jahr 1115 leitete er eine Expedition nach Transjordanien und baute die Burg von Montreal. Die in der Gegend lebenden syrischen Christen wurden eingeladen, sich in Jerusalem niederzulassen, um die Bevlkerung wieder aufzufllen, die 1099 grtenteils massakriert worden war. 1117 baute er die Burg Skandalion in der Nhe von Tyrus, die noch in muslimischer Hand war. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt bestand die Armee im Knigreich Jerusalem nur aus 6.000 Mann, darunter 1.000 Ritter, wurde aber durch 5.000 Turcopoles verstrkt. [PARAGRAPH:1]Im Jahr 1117 wurde Balduin krank. Er war berzeugt, dass die Krankheit auf seine bigamische Ehe mit Adelaide zurckzufhren war, und als Reaktion darauf wurde Adelaide zu ihrem groen Ekel nach Sizilien zurckgeschickt. Balduin erholte sich jedoch und marschierte 1118 in gypten ein und plnderte Farama. Dann wurde er erneut krank und starb auf dem Rckweg nach Jerusalem. Fulcher von Chartres sagt: "Die Franken weinten, die Syrer und sogar die Sarazenen, die es sahen, waren ebenfalls betrbt." Sein Cousin Balduin von Bourcq wurde zu seinem Nachfolger gewhlt, obwohl das Knigreich auch Eustachius III. angeboten wurde, der es nicht wollte.</German>

He was the brother of Godfrey of Bouillon, who was the first ruler of the crusader state of Jerusalem, although he refused the title of 'king' which Baldwin accepted. [PARAGRAPH:1]Baldwin joined the First Crusade in 1096 with his brothers Godfrey and Eustace III of Boulogne, selling much of his property to the church in order to pay for his expenses. Baldwin accompanied his brothers as far as Heraclea in Asia Minor, where he broke away from the main body of the crusaders to march into Cilicia. He briefly occupied Tarsus and Turbessel, then was adopted by Thoros of Edessa, becoming Thoros' son and successor. When Thoros was assassinated in March of 1098, Baldwin became the first count of Edessa, although it is unknown if he played any role in the assassination. He ruled the county until 1100, marrying Arda, the daughter of Thoros, and acted as an ambassador between the crusaders and Armenians. [PARAGRAPH:1]After the death of Baldwin's brother Godfrey in 1100, he was crowned the first king of Jerusalem and quickly began  expanding his territory. In 1101 he captured Arsuf and Caesarea, with assistance from a Genoese fleet. In return the Genoese were granted trading quarters in these towns, and an archbishopric was established in Caesarea. In 1103 Baldwin besieged Acre, without success as it was relieved by an Egyptian fleet. In 1104 however Baldwin was assisted by a Genoese fleet and Acre was captured. In 1105 another battle was fought at Ramlah and Baldwin was victorious here as well. In 1110 Beirut was added to the territory of Jerusalem, again with help from the Genoese. [PARAGRAPH:1]In 1113 Baldwin faced a large invasion by the combined forces of Toghtekin of Damascus and Aksunk-ur of Mosul, and though the kingdom was on the brink of destruction Baldwin was assisted by troops from Antioch and new arrivals of European pilgrims at the Battle of Al-Sannabra. In 1113 he also married Adelaide del Vasto; he had abandoned his Armenian wife Arda in 1108, on the pretext that she had been unfaithful, or, according to Guibert of Nogent, because she had been raped by pirates on the way to Jerusalem. It is more likely however that she was simply politically useless in Jerusalem, which had no Armenian population. Technically the marriage to Adelaide was bigamous because Arda was still alive in a monastery in Jerusalem, and it would later cause many problems both for Baldwin and Patriarch Arnulf, who had sanctioned it. [PARAGRAPH:1]In 1115 he led an expedition into Transjordan and built the castle of Montreal. The Syrian Christians who lived in the area were invited to settle in Jerusalem to replenish the population, which had been mostly massacred in 1099. In 1117 he built the castle of Scandalion near Tyre, which was still in Muslim hands. At this point the army in the Kingdom of Jerusalem consisted of only 6,000 men, including 1,000 knights but it was augmented with 5,000 turcopoles. [PARAGRAPH:1]In 1117 Baldwin fell ill. He was convinced that the sickness was due to his bigamous marriage to Adelaide, and in response Adelaide was sent back to Sicily, much to her disgust. Baldwin recovered, however, and in 1118 he marched into Egypt and plundered Farama. Then he fell ill again and died on the way back to Jerusalem. Fulcher of Chartres says "The Franks wept, the Syrians, and even the Saracens who saw it grieved also." His cousin Baldwin of Bourcq was chosen as his successor, although the kingdom was also offered to Eustace III, who did not want it.</Italian>

Juli 1194[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Guy von Lusignan war ein Poitevin-Ritter, Sohn von Hugo VIII. aus der Lusignan-Dynastie. Er war von 1186 bis 1192 Knig des Kreuzfahrerstaates Jerusalem aufgrund der Heirat mit Sibylla von Jerusalem und von 1192 bis 1194 Knig von Zypern. Zu einem unbekannten Zeitpunkt im Heiligen Land angekommen (wo sein Bruder Amalrich bereits prominent war), Guy heiratete 1180 berstrzt Sibylla, um einen politischen Zwischenfall im Knigreich zu verhindern. Als sich Baldwins Gesundheitszustand verschlechterte, wurde Guy zum Regenten von Jerusalem ernannt; Bei Sibyllas Thronfolge im Jahr 1186 schenkte sie Guy die Krone als ihrem Knigsgemahl. Guys Regierungszeit war von zunehmenden Feindseligkeiten mit den von Saladin regierten Ayyubiden geprgt, die in der verheerenden Schlacht von Hattin im Juli 1187 - in der Guy gefangen genommen wurde - und dem Fall Jerusalems selbst drei Monate spter ihren Hhepunkt fanden. [PARAGRAPH:1]Nach einem Jahr Haft in Damaskus wurde Guy von Saladin freigelassen. Nachdem ihm Konrad von Montferrat den Zutritt zu Tyros, einer der letzten Kreuzfahrerhochburgen, verweigert hatte, belagerte Guy 1189 Acre. Die Belagerung entwickelte sich zu einem Sammelpunkt fr den Dritten Kreuzzug, angefhrt von Philipp Augustus von Frankreich und Sibyllas Cousin ersten Grades, der einst vertrieben worden war , Richard Lwenherz. Guy geriet mit Konrad in einen erbitterten Streit um das Knigtum von Jerusalem; Trotz Richards Untersttzung fr Guy wurde Conrad vom Adel des Knigreichs zum Knig gewhlt. Conrad wurde wenige Tage nach der Wahl von den Hashshashin ermordet; Die Beteiligung von Richard und Guy an dem Vorfall wird vermutet, ist jedoch nicht bewiesen. Dennoch wurde Guy fr die Enteignung seiner Krone entschdigt, indem er 1192 die Herrschaft ber Zypern erhielt, das Richard auf dem Weg in die Levante vom Byzantinischen Reich annektiert hatte. Guy regierte das Knigreich Zypern bis zu seinem Tod im Jahr 1194, als sein Bruder Amalric seine Nachfolge antrat.</German>

Bohemond of Taranto  led the siege, beginning in October, 1097. With over four hundred towers, the city was almost impenetrable. The siege lasted throughout the winter, with much suffering among the Crusaders, who were often forced to eat their own horses, or, as legend has it, the bodies of their fellow Christians who had not survived.[PARAGRAPH:1]However, Bohemond convinced a guard in one of the towers, a former Christian named Firouz, to let the Crusaders enter the city.

Bohemond and the other Italian Normans eventually won, and Bohemond named himself prince. Bohemond was already prince of Taranto in Italy, and he desired to continue such independence in his new lordship; thus he did not attempt to receive the title of Duke from the Byzantine Emperor (in whose name he had taken an oath to fight), nor any other title with deep feudal obligations, such as count.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bohemond I was captured in battle with the Danishmends in 1100, and his nephew Tancred became regent.

		<German>[TAB]Whrend Balduin von Boulogne und Tankred von Kleinasien nach Osten zog, um die Grafschaft Edessa zu errichten, zog die Hauptarmee des Ersten Kreuzzugs weiter nach Sden, um Antiochia zu belagern. Bohemund von Taranto fhrte die Belagerung an, die im Oktober 1097 begann. Mit ber vierhundert Trmen war die Stadt nahezu uneinnehmbar. Die Belagerung dauerte den ganzen Winter und brachte viel Leid unter den Kreuzfahrern, die oft gezwungen waren, ihre eigenen Pferde zu essen, oder, wie die Legende sagt, die Leichen ihrer Mitchristen, die nicht berlebt hatten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Allerdings, Bohemond berzeugte einen Wachmann in einem der Trme, einen ehemaligen Christen namens Firouz, den Kreuzfahrern den Zutritt zur Stadt zu ermglichen. Er tat dies am 3. Juni 1098 und es kam zu einem Massaker an den muslimischen Einwohnern. Es gab einen langen Streit darber, wer die Stadt kontrollieren sollte. Bohemond und die anderen italienischen Normannen gewannen schlielich und Bohemond ernannte sich selbst zum Prinzen. Bohemond war bereits Prinz von Taranto in Italien und wollte diese Unabhngigkeit auch in seiner neuen Herrschaft beibehalten; Daher versuchte er nicht, vom byzantinischen Kaiser (in dessen Namen er einen Kampfeid geschworen hatte) den Titel eines Herzogs oder einen anderen Titel mit tiefen feudalen Verpflichtungen wie den Grafentitel zu erhalten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bohemund I. wurde gefangen genommen im Kampf mit den Danishmends im Jahr 1100, und sein Neffe Tancred wurde Regent. Tankred erweiterte die Grenzen des Frstentums und eroberte die Stdte Tarsus und Latakia vom Byzantinischen Reich. Bohemond wurde 1103 freigelassen, berlie Tancred jedoch erneut die Regentschaft, als er 1105 nach Italien ging, um weitere Truppen aufzustellen. Mit diesen Truppen griff er 1107 die Byzantiner an, wurde jedoch besiegt. Bohemond kmpfte auch mit Balduin und Joscelin aus der Grafschaft Edessa gegen Aleppo; Als Balduin und Joscelin gefangen genommen wurden, wurde Tancred auch Regent in Edessa. Bohemond verlie Tancred erneut als Regent und kehrte nach Italien zurck, wo er 1111 starb.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nach dem Fall von Edessa im Jahr 1144 wurde Antiochia whrend des Zweiten Kreuzzugs von Nur ad-Din angegriffen. Ein groer Teil des stlichen Teils des Frstentums ging an die Muslime verloren. Ab der zweiten Hlfte des 12. Jahrhunderts nahm Antiochia nicht mehr aktiv an den Kreuzzgen teil. Stattdessen fhrten seine Herrscher einen stndigen politischen und militrischen Kampf mit den Zengiden, Byzantinern, Armeniern und Tripolis und wechselten hufig die Verbndeten und Feinde. Als die Mongolen 1260 in der Schlacht von Ain Jalut besiegt wurden, begann der Mamluken-Sultan Baibars, Antiochia zu bedrohen, das (als Vasall der Armenier) die Mongolen untersttzt hatte. Baibars eroberten schlielich 1268 die Stadt und ganz Nordsyrien war schnell verloren; 23 Jahre spter wurde Acre eingenommen und die Kreuzfahrerstaaten hrten auf zu existieren.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]While Baldwin of Boulogne and Tancred headed east from Asia Minor to set up the County of Edessa, the main army of the First Crusade continued south to besiege Antioch. Bohemond of Taranto  led the siege, beginning in October, 1097. With over four hundred towers, the city was almost impenetrable. The siege lasted throughout the winter, with much suffering among the Crusaders, who were often forced to eat their own horses, or, as legend has it, the bodies of their fellow Christians who had not survived.[PARAGRAPH:1]However, Bohemond convinced a guard in one of the towers, a former Christian named Firouz, to let the Crusaders enter the city. He did so on June 3, 1098, and a massacre of the Muslim inhabitants followed. There was a lengthy dispute over who should control the city. Bohemond and the other Italian Normans eventually won, and Bohemond named himself prince. Bohemond was already prince of Taranto in Italy, and he desired to continue such independence in his new lordship; thus he did not attempt to receive the title of Duke from the Byzantine Emperor (in whose name he had taken an oath to fight), nor any other title with deep feudal obligations, such as count.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bohemond I was captured in battle with the Danishmends in 1100, and his nephew Tancred became regent. Tancred expanded the borders of the Principality, taking the cities of Tarsus and Latakia from the Byzantine Empire. Bohemond was released in 1103, but left Tancred as regent again when he went to Italy to raise more troops in 1105. He used these troops to attack the Byzantines in 1107, but was defeated. Bohemond also fought Aleppo with Baldwin and Joscelin of the County of Edessa; when Baldwin and Joscelin were captured, Tancred became regent in Edessa as well. Bohemond left Tancred as regent once more and returned to Italy, where he died in 1111.[PARAGRAPH:1]After the fall of Edessa in 1144, Antioch was attacked by Nur ad-Din during the Second Crusade. Much of the eastern part of the Principality was lost to the Muslims. From the second half of the 12th century onwards, Antioch took no active part in the Crusades. Instead, its rulers engaged in constant political and military struggle with the Zengids, Byzantines, Armenians and Tripoli, often switching alliegance and enemies.

He was born in San Marco Argentano, Calabria, as the eldest son of the Norman nobleman Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia and Calabria, and his first wife Alberada of Buonalbergo.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bohemond served under his father in the great attack on the Byzantine Empire (10801085) and commanded the Normans during Guiscard's absence (10821084), penetrating into Thessaly as far as Larissa, but being eventually repulsed by Alexius I Comnenus. This early hostility to Alexius had a great influence in determining the course and policy of the Empire from time of Bohemond (whom his father had destined for the throne of Constantinople) to that of Roger II of Sicily.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1096, Bohemond, along with his uncle Roger I of Sicily the great count of Sicily, was attacking Amalfi, which had revolted against Duke Roger, when bands of crusaders began to pass, on their way through Italy to Constantinople. The zeal of the crusader came upon Bohemond: it is possible however, that he saw in the First Crusade nothing more than a chance to carve for himself an eastern principality. Geoffrey Malaterra bluntly states that Bohemond took the Cross with the intention of plundering and conquering Greek lands.[PARAGRAPH:1]He gathered a Norman army, perhaps one of the finest in the crusading host, at the head of which he crossed the Adriatic Sea, and penetrated to Constantinople along the route he had tried to follow in 10821084. He was careful to observe a "correct" attitude towards Alexius, and when he arrived at Constantinople in April 1097 he did homage to the emperor. From Constantinople to Antioch, Bohemond was the real leader of the First Crusade; and it says much for his leadership that the First Crusade succeeded in crossing Asia Minor, which the Crusade of 1101, the Second Crusade in 1147, and the Third Crusade in 1189 failed to accomplish.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bohemond was the first to get into position before Antioch, and he took a great part in the siege of the city. The capture of Antioch was due to his connection with Firouz, one of the commanders in the city; but he would not bring matters to an issue until the possession of the city was assured him in 1098. He stayed in the neighbourhood of Antioch to secure his position, while the other crusaders moved southward to the capture of Jerusalem.[PARAGRAPH:1]It might seem that Bohemond was destined to found a great principality in Antioch, which would dwarf Jerusalem; he had a fine territory, a good strategic position and a strong army. But he had to face two great forcesthe Byzantine Empire, which claimed the whole of his territories and was supported in its claim by Raymond of Toulouse, and the strong Muslim principalities in the north-east of Syria. Against these two forces he failed.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bohemond was decisively defeated by Muslim forces while marching on Harran. This defeat was followed by Greek attack on Cilicia, previously captured for the principality by Tancred, Bohemond's nephew. In late 1104 Bohemond returned to Europe for reinforcements. He enthralled audiences across France with gifts of relics from the Holy Land and tales of heroism while fighting the infidel, gathering a large army in the process. His new found status won him the hand of Constance, the daughter of the French king, Philip I. [PARAGRAPH:1]Dazzled by his success, Bohemond resolved to use his army of 34,000 men, not to defend Antioch against the Greeks, but to attack Alexius. He did so; but Alexius, aided by the Venetians, proved too strong, and Bohemond had to submit to a humiliating peace, by which he became the vassal of Alexius, consented to receive his pay, with the title of sebastos, and promised to cede disputed territories and to admit a Greek patriarch into Antioch. Henceforth Bohemond was a broken man. He died without returning to the East, and was buried at Canosa in Apulia, in 1111. The principality he founded, however, survived for 170 years.</English>

		<German>[H1]Bohemond I. von Antiochia[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prinz von Taranto und Antiochia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] ca. 1058 - 3. Mrz 1111[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Bohemond I. war einer der Anfhrer des Ersten Kreuzzugs und der Grnder des Frstentums Antiochia. Er wurde in San Marco Argentano, Kalabrien, als ltester Sohn des normannischen Adligen Robert Guiscard, Herzog von Apulien und Kalabrien, und seiner ersten Frau Alberada von Buonalbergo geboren.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bohemond diente unter seinem Vater beim groen Angriff auf das Byzantinische Reich (1080-1085) und befehligte die Normannen whrend Guiscards Abwesenheit (1082-1084), drang bis nach Larissa in Thessalien ein, wurde aber schlielich von Alexios I. Komnenos zurckgeschlagen. Diese frhe Feindseligkeit gegenber Alexius hatte groen Einfluss auf den Kurs und die Politik des Reiches von der Zeit Bohemunds (den sein Vater fr den Thron von Konstantinopel vorgesehen hatte) bis zur Zeit Rogers II. von Sizilien.[PARAGRAPH:1]Im Jahr 1096 Bohemond griff zusammen mit seinem Onkel Roger I. von Sizilien, dem groen Grafen von Sizilien, Amalfi an, das sich gegen Herzog Roger aufgelehnt hatte, als Kreuzfahrerbanden auf ihrem Weg durch Italien nach Konstantinopel durchzogen. Der Eifer des Kreuzfahrers berkam Bohemund: Es ist jedoch mglich, dass er im Ersten Kreuzzug nichts weiter sah als eine Chance, sich ein stliches Frstentum zu erarbeiten. Geoffrey Malaterra gibt unverblmt an, dass Bohemond das Kreuz mit der Absicht nahm, griechische Lnder zu plndern und zu erobern.[PARAGRAPH:1]Er versammelte eine normannische Armee, vielleicht eine der besten der Kreuzzugsarmee, an deren Spitze er das Adriatische Meer berquerte und drang auf dem Weg, den er 1082-1084 versucht hatte, nach Konstantinopel vor. Er achtete darauf, eine "richtige" Haltung gegenber Alexius einzunehmen, und als er im April 1097 in Konstantinopel ankam, huldigte er dem Kaiser. Von Konstantinopel bis Antiochia war Bohemund der eigentliche Anfhrer des Ersten Kreuzzugs; und es sagt viel ber seine Fhrung aus, dass es dem Ersten Kreuzzug gelang, Kleinasien zu durchqueren, was dem Kreuzzug von 1101, dem Zweiten Kreuzzug von 1147 und dem Dritten Kreuzzug von 1189 nicht gelang.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bohemond war der Erste, der es schaffte stellte sich vor Antiochia in Stellung und beteiligte sich mageblich an der Belagerung der Stadt. Die Einnahme von Antiochia war auf seine Verbindung mit Firouz, einem der Kommandeure der Stadt, zurckzufhren; aber er brachte die Sache nicht zur Entscheidung, bis ihm 1098 der Besitz der Stadt zugesichert wurde. Er blieb in der Nhe von Antiochia, um seine Position zu sichern, whrend die anderen Kreuzfahrer nach Sden zogen, um Jerusalem einzunehmen.[ABSATZ:1] Es knnte scheinen, dass Bohemond dazu bestimmt war, in Antiochia ein groes Frstentum zu grnden, das Jerusalem in den Schatten stellen wrde; er hatte ein schnes Territorium, eine gute strategische Position und eine starke Armee. Aber er musste sich zwei groen Mchten stellen: dem Byzantinischen Reich, das sein gesamtes Territorium beanspruchte und in seinem Anspruch von Raymond von Toulouse untersttzt wurde, und den starken muslimischen Frstentmern im Nordosten Syriens. Gegen diese beiden Krfte scheiterte er.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bohemond wurde von muslimischen Streitkrften entscheidend geschlagen, als er auf Harran marschierte. Dieser Niederlage folgte ein griechischer Angriff auf Kilikien, das Tancred, Bohemonds Neffe, zuvor fr das Frstentum erobert hatte. Ende 1104 kehrte Bohemund zur Verstrkung nach Europa zurck. Er begeisterte das Publikum in ganz Frankreich mit Geschenken von Reliquien aus dem Heiligen Land und Geschichten ber Heldentum im Kampf gegen die Unglubigen und stellte dabei eine groe Armee zusammen. Sein neu gewonnener Status brachte ihm die Hand von Konstanze ein, der Tochter des franzsischen Knigs Philipp I. [PARAGRAPH:1]Von seinem Erfolg geblendet, beschloss Bohemond, seine Armee von 34.000 Mann einzusetzen, nicht um Antiochia gegen die Griechen zu verteidigen, sondern Alexius anzugreifen. Er tat es; Aber Alexius erwies sich mit Untersttzung der Venezianer als zu stark, und Bohemond musste sich einem demtigenden Frieden unterwerfen, durch den er zum Vasallen von Alexius wurde, sich bereit erklrte, seinen Lohn mit dem Titel Sebastos zu erhalten, und versprach, umstrittene Gebiete abzutreten einen griechischen Patriarchen in Antiochia aufzunehmen. Fortan war Bohemund ein gebrochener Mann. Er starb, ohne in den Osten zurckzukehren, und wurde 1111 in Canosa in Apulien beigesetzt. Das von ihm gegrndete Frstentum berlebte jedoch 170 Jahre.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Georgia has one of the world's richest and oldest histories, stretching back to the prehistoric times. The rise of the early Georgian states of Colchis and Iberia in c.2000 BC formed the unique Georgian civilization which achieved its renaissance and golden age in 12-13th century.[PARAGRAPH:1]The first united Georgian monarchy was formed at the end of the 10th century when Curopalate David invaded the Earldom of Kartli-Iberia. Three years later, after the death of his uncle Theodosius the Blind, King of Egrisi-Abkhazia, Bagrat III inherited the Abkhazian throne. In 1001 Bagrat added Curopalatinate of Iberia to his domain as a result of David's death. In 1008-1010, Bagrat annexed Kakheti and Ereti, thus becoming the first king of a united Georgia.[PARAGRAPH:1]The second half of the 11th century was marked by the disastrous invasion of the Seljuk Turks, who by the end of the 1040s had succeeded in building a vast nomadic empire including most of Central Asia and Persia. In 1071, the Seljuk army destroyed the united Byzantine-Armenian and Georgian forces in the battle of Manzikert. By 1081, all of Armenia, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Syria, and most of Georgia had been conquered and devastated by the Seljuks. In Georgia, only the mountainous areas of Abkhazia, Svanetia, Racha, and Khevi-Khevsureti remained out of Seljuk control and served as a relatively safe havens for numerous refugees. [PARAGRAPH:1]Although they were subsequently beset by various other invaders, principally Arabs, Mongols, Persians, and Turks, the Georgians retained a greater or lesser degree of independence for over 1,000 years. Thus after 1008, all Georgian principalities were united into the unified Kingdom of Georgia (1008-1466) under the Bagrationi dynasty.[PARAGRAPH:1]The struggle against the Seljuk invaders in Georgia was led by the young King David IV of the Bagrationi royal family, who inherited the throne in 1089 at the age of 16 after the abdication of his father George II Bagrationi. Soon after coming to power, David created the regular army and peasant militia in order to be able to resist Seljuk colonization of his country. The Crusaders' offensive against Seljuk Turks in Anatolia and Syria favored David's successful campaigns in Georgia. By the end of 1099 David had stopped paying tribute to the Seljuks and had liberated most of the Georgian lands. In 1103 he reorganized the Georgian Orthodox Church and closely linked it with the state. Between 1103 and 1122, David took over the lands of Ereti, Kartli and Tashiri, including Tbilisi, making it Georgia's capital.[PARAGRAPH:1]The reign of Queen Tamar represented the peak of Georgia's might. In 1194-1204 Tamar's armies crushed new Turkish invasions from the south-east and south and launched several successful campaigns into Turkish-controlled lands. As a result, most of Southern Armenia came under Georgian control.[PARAGRAPH:1]The temporary fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1204 to the Crusaders left Georgia as the strongest Christian state in the whole East Mediterranean area. The same year Queen Tamar sent her troops to take over the former Byzantine Lazona and Paryadria. In 1205, the occupied territory was transformed into the Empire of Trebizond and Tamar's relative Prince Alexios Komnenos was crowned as Emperor. The Empire of Trebizond was heavily dependent on Georgia for more than two hundred years. [PARAGRAPH:1]In the 13th century, the South Caucasus and Asia Minor faced the invasion of the Mongols. In spite of the fierce resistance on behalf of the united Georgian-Armenian forces, the whole area including most of Georgia, all Armenian lands and Central Anatolia fell to the Mongols. In 1386-1403 the diminished Kingdom of Georgia faced eight more Turco-Mongolic invasions under the leadership of Tamerlane that probably happened to be the most destructive cataclysm in the whole history of the nation. All over Georgia except Abkhazia and Svanetia, the cities and towns fell in ruins, tens of thousands were brutally slaughtered and even more enslaved and deported. Still, Georgia survived and turned into an isolated, fractured Christian enclave, a relic of the faded East Roman epoch surrounded by Muslim, predominantly Turco-Iranian-Arabic world.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Georgien hat eine der reichsten und ltesten Geschichten der Welt, die bis in die prhistorische Zeit zurckreicht. Der Aufstieg der frhen georgischen Staaten Kolchis und Iberia im Jahr 2000 v. Chr. formte die einzigartige georgische Zivilisation, die im 12. und 13. Jahrhundert ihre Renaissance und ihr goldenes Zeitalter erlebte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die erste vereinte georgische Monarchie wurde am Ende gegrndet im 10. Jahrhundert, als Kuropalat David in die Grafschaft Kartli-Iberien einfiel. Drei Jahre spter, nach dem Tod seines Onkels Theodosius dem Blinden, Knig von Egrisi-Abchasien, erbte Bagrat III. den abchasischen Thron. Im Jahr 1001 fgte Bagrat infolge von Davids Tod das Curopalatinate von Iberia zu seinem Herrschaftsbereich hinzu. In den Jahren 1008-1010 annektierte Bagrat Kachetien und Ereti und wurde so der erste Knig eines vereinten Georgiens.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die zweite Hlfte des 11. Jahrhunderts war geprgt von der verheerenden Invasion der seldschukischen Trken, die am Ende des In den 1040er Jahren war es gelungen, ein riesiges Nomadenreich aufzubauen, das den grten Teil Zentralasiens und Persiens umfasste. Im Jahr 1071 vernichtete die seldschukische Armee die vereinten byzantinisch-armenischen und georgischen Streitkrfte in der Schlacht von Manzikert. Bis 1081 waren ganz Armenien, Anatolien, Mesopotamien, Syrien und der grte Teil Georgiens von den Seldschuken erobert und verwstet worden. In Georgien blieben nur die Berggebiete Abchasiens, Swanetiens, Ratschas und Khevi-Chewsuretiens auerhalb der Kontrolle der Seldschuken und dienten zahlreichen Flchtlingen als relativ sichere Zufluchtsorte. [PARAGRAPH:1]Obwohl sie anschlieend von verschiedenen anderen Eindringlingen bedrngt wurden, hauptschlich Arabern, Mongolen, Persern und Trken, behielten die Georgier ber 1.000 Jahre lang einen mehr oder weniger groen Grad an Unabhngigkeit. So wurden nach 1008 alle georgischen Frstentmer unter der Bagrationi-Dynastie zum vereinten Knigreich Georgien (1008-1466) vereint.[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Kampf gegen die seldschukischen Invasoren in Georgien wurde vom jungen Knig David IV. vom Bagrationi-Knigshaus angefhrt Familie, die 1089 im Alter von 16 Jahren nach der Abdankung seines Vaters Georg II. Bagrationi den Thron erbte. Bald nach seiner Machtbernahme grndete David eine regulre Armee und eine Bauernmiliz, um der seldschukischen Kolonisierung seines Landes widerstehen zu knnen. Die Offensive der Kreuzfahrer gegen die seldschukischen Trken in Anatolien und Syrien begnstigte Davids erfolgreiche Feldzge in Georgien. Ende 1099 hatte David aufgehrt, den Seldschuken Tribut zu zahlen, und die meisten georgischen Lnder befreit. Im Jahr 1103 organisierte er die georgisch-orthodoxe Kirche neu und verband sie eng mit dem Staat. Zwischen 1103 und 1122 bernahm David die Lnder Ereti, Kartli und Tashiri, einschlielich Tiflis, und machte es zur Hauptstadt Georgiens.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Herrschaft von Knigin Tamar stellte den Hhepunkt der Macht Georgiens dar. In den Jahren 1194-1204 schlugen Tamars Armeen neue trkische Invasionen aus dem Sdosten und Sden nieder und starteten mehrere erfolgreiche Feldzge in trkisch kontrollierte Gebiete. Infolgedessen geriet der grte Teil Sdarmeniens unter georgische Kontrolle.[PARAGRAPH:1]Der vorbergehende Fall des Byzantinischen Reiches im Jahr 1204 an die Kreuzfahrer hinterlie Georgien als strksten christlichen Staat im gesamten stlichen Mittelmeerraum. Im selben Jahr schickte Knigin Tamar ihre Truppen, um das ehemalige byzantinische Lazona und Paryadria einzunehmen. Im Jahr 1205 wurde das besetzte Gebiet in das Reich von Trapezunt umgewandelt und Tamars Verwandter, Prinz Alexios Komnenos, zum Kaiser gekrnt. Das Reich von Trapezunt war mehr als zweihundert Jahre lang stark von Georgien abhngig. [PARAGRAPH:1]Im 13. Jahrhundert waren der Sdkaukasus und Kleinasien mit der Invasion der Mongolen konfrontiert. Trotz des erbitterten Widerstands der vereinten georgisch-armenischen Streitkrfte fiel das gesamte Gebiet, einschlielich des grten Teils Georgiens, aller armenischen Gebiete und Zentralanatoliens, an die Mongolen. In den Jahren 1386-1403 erlebte das geschwchte Knigreich Georgien unter der Fhrung von Tamerlan acht weitere trkisch-mongolische Invasionen, die wahrscheinlich die zerstrerischste Katastrophe in der gesamten Geschichte des Landes darstellten. In ganz Georgien, auer Abchasien und Swanetien, verfielen Stdte und Gemeinden, Zehntausende wurden brutal abgeschlachtet und noch mehr versklavt und deportiert. Dennoch berlebte Georgien und verwandelte sich in eine isolierte, zersplitterte christliche Enklave, ein Relikt der verblassten ostrmischen Epoche, umgeben von einer muslimischen, berwiegend trkisch-iranisch-arabischen Welt.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Buyid dynasty, also known as the Buyid Empire or the Buyids, also known as Buwaihids, Buyahids, or Buyyids, were a Shia Persian dynasty that originated from Daylaman in Gilan. They founded a confederation that controlled most of modern-day Iran and Iraq in the 10th and 11th centuries.[PARAGRAPH:1]The founders of the Buyid confederation were Ali ibn Buyah and his two younger brothers, al-Hassan and Ahmad. Originally a soldier in the service of the Ziyarids of Tabaristan, Ali was able to recruit an army to defeat a Turkish general from Baghdad named Yaqut in 934. Over the next nine years the three brothers gained control of the remainder of the Abbasid Caliphate. While they accepted the titular authority of the caliph in Baghdad, the Buyid rulers assumed effective control of the state.[PARAGRAPH:1]The first several decades of the Buyid confederation were characterized by large territorial gains. In addition to Fars and Jibal, which were conquered in the 930s, and central Iraq, which submitted in 945, the Buyids took Kerman (967), Oman (967), the Jazira (979), Tabaristan (980), and Gurgan (981).

		<English>[TAB]The Bulgars originally came from Central Asia, 'somewhere east of the Black Sea,' near modern day Kazakhstan and were occasional allies of the Huns. They began sporadic service with the Byzantines asmercenaries in the late 5th cent., and by the time of Emperor Justinian I were actually administering some towns in the Empire, defending them against other Bulgars and nomadic tribes from the east. The Bulgars had a falling outwith the Empire, retreated to the steppes, and were next heard from when they joined the Gepids and Lombards in invading Italy. Around 600 AD, the Bulgars had returned and conquered the Slavic area of the Balkans controlled bythe Byzantines. The Byzantine Empire recognized the first Bulgarian Empire in 681 AD, and this nation lasted until 1081 AD.[PARAGRAPH:2]Even though the Bulgars ruled this area with an iron fist, they ended up assimilating much of the Slavic language and culture and eventually would mingle so much with their subjects that eventually it was impossible to determine who was Bulgar and who was Slav. This interbreeding with their Slavic subjects did not dull their ferocity however, and during the Middle Ages Bulgaria was a great military power. The Bulgars fought many wars against the Byzantine Empire, their other neighbors, and nomadic invaders.

		<German>[TAB]Die Bulgaren kamen ursprnglich aus Zentralasien, "irgendwo stlich des Schwarzen Meeres", nahe dem heutigen Kasachstan und waren gelegentlich Alliierte der Hunnen. Ende des fnften Jahrhunderts fingen sie vereinzelt an, Byzanz als Sldner zu dienen, und zur Zeit Kaiser Justinians I. verwalteten sie sogar einige Stdte im Reich, die sie gegen andere Bulgaren und nomadische Stmme aus dem Osten verteidigten. Die Bulgaren hatten einen Fall auerhalb des Reichs, zogen sich in die Steppe zurck und wurden zum nchsten Mal gehrt, als sie zusammen mit den Gepiden und den Lombarden in Italien einfielen. Um 600 n. Chr. kehrten die Bulgaren um und eroberten das slawische Gebiet des Balkans, das von Byzanz kontrolliert wurde. Das Byzantinische Reich erkannte das Erste Bulgarische Reich 681 n. Chr. an und diese Nation dauerte bis 1081 an.[PARAGRAPH:2]Obwohl die Bulgaren dieses Gebiet mit eiserner Faust regierten, nahmen sie letztendlich viel von der slawischen Sprache und Kultur an und vermischten sich derart mit den Slawen, dass es unmglich war, zu unterscheiden, wer Bulgare und wer Slawe war. Diese Vermischung mit dem slawischen Volk stumpfte ihre Wildheit jedoch nicht ab und whrend des Mittelalters war Bulgarien eine groe militrische Macht. Die Bulgaren kmpften mehrfach gegen das Byzantinische Reich, ihre anderen Nachbarn und nomadische Eindringlinge. 865 konvertierte Zar Boris I. zum Christentum und etablierte einen unabhngigen bulgarischen Ableger der stlich-Orthodoxen Kirche und bernahm das Kyrillische Alphabet in die offizielle Amtssprache. Dieses Alphabet und diese Kirche breitete sich von Bulgarien zum Rest Osteuropas und dann nach Russland aus. Boris' Sohn, Zar Simeon I. (893-927) war einer von Bulgariens grten Herrschern und whrend seiner Herrschaft blhte Bulgarien als ein Zentrum slawischer Kultur und Bildung auf. Geziemend seinem kriegerischen Erbe, eroberte Simeon auch viele Gebiete und zu seinem Tod erstreckte sich Bulgarien vom Schwarzen Meer bis zur Adria. Nach Simeons Tod nahm Bulgariens Macht ab und wurde letztendlich von den Byzantinern erobert. Nach fast 200 Jahren der byzantinischen Herrschaft folgte 200 Jahre lang ein Zweites Bulgarisches Reich, das wiederum vom Osmanischen Reich erobert wurde.</German>

Simeon was born to a Christianized Bulgaria due to his father's reign. In his early years, Simeon learned the Greek language and received a theological education in Constantinople. Although Simeon's brother Vladimir was the designated heir of Boris, he was deposed after attempting to reintroduce paganism to Bulgaria and Simeon became king.[PARAGRAPH:2]Under the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI, the Bulgarian marketplace was moved from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, where the Bulgarian merchants were heavily taxed. The merchants then required protection from Simeon, who invaded the Byzantine Empire in 894. However, the Bulgarian army was required back in the country after a Magyar invasion from the north. Later, the Magyars were convinced by the Byzantines to attack Bulgaria. Simeon, being unaware of this agreement, met another force of Byzantines from Italy. After agreeing to peace with the Byzantine commander, Simeon blocked off the Byzantine navy's route into the Danube. Simeon, after hearing of the Magyar attack, moved to confront them. The Magyars defeated Bulgaria and later pillaged its land, and Simeon agreed to peace with Byzantium in 895.[PARAGRAPH:2]Now that the Byzantine threat was abolished, Simeon planned a campaign against the Magyars. Simeon defeated the Magyars and expanded Bulgarian territory. Simeon then defeated a Byzantine army after a dispute about Bulgarian prisoners in Thrace. The war ended and Byzantium was required to pay an annual tribute and cede lands to Bulgaria. However, Simeon often violated these treaties, conquering and attacking Byzantine territory on several occasions.[PARAGRAPH:2]Leo VI's death paved the way for another Bulgarian invasion of Byzantium. Simeon was recognized as Emperor of the Bulgarians after negotiations with the Byzantines. In 917, the Byzantines planned a campaign against eh Bulgarians. In the Battle of Anchialos, one of the largest medieval battles in history, Simeon defeated the Byzantines. In order to cease Serbian unrest, Simeon removed the current Serbian ruler and replaced him with another, ensuring Bulgarian influence over Serbia.[PARAGRAPH:2]After another government change in Constantinople, Simeon declared war on Byzantium to further assert his power. He captured several Byzantine cities and requested the help of the Arabs. However, the Arabs accepted peace with the Byzantines, thus ruining their alliance with Bulgaria. Simeon was forced to establish peace with Byzantium after the threat of a Serbian uprising, where he deposed the Serbian ruler. In 926, Simeon's troops invaded Croatia, but were defeated by the army of King Tomislav. In the last years of his life, Simeon prepared for another siege of Constantinople. On May 27, 927, Simeon died of heart failure in his palace in Preslav and was succeeded by his son Peter I.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Serbs in the Byzantine world lived in the so-called Slav lands, lands initially out of Byzantine control and independent. The Vlastimirovic dynasty established the Serbian Principality in the 7th century. In 822, Frankish annalists recorded that for the Serbs "is said to be holding the large part of Dalmatia. Christianization of Serbs, initiated in the 7th century, was a gradual process, finalized by the middle of the 9th century. In the mid-10th century, Serbian state stretched between the shores of the Adriatic Sea, the Neretva, the Sava, the Morava, and Skadar. Ethnic identity of local populations remains a matter of historiographical disputes.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 924, the Serbs ambushed and defeated a small Bulgarian army, provoking a major retaliatory campaign that ended with Bulgaria's annexation of Serbia at the end of that year. Threatened by an alliance between the Byzantines and the Serbian state of Duklja, in 997 the Bulgarian tsar Samuel defeated and captured its Prince Jovan Vladimir and took control of the Serb lands again. The state disintegrated after the death of the last known Vlastimirid ruler; the Byzantines annexed the region and held it for a century, until 1040 when the Serbs under the leadership of what would become the Vojislavljevic dynasty revolted in Duklja, a maritime region. In 1091, the Vukanovic dynasty established the Serbian Grand Principality, based in Raska (Latin: Rascia).[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1166, Stefan Nemanja assumed the throne, marking the beginning of a prospering Serbia, henceforth under the rule of the Nemanjic dynasty. Nemanja's son Rastko (posth. Saint Sava), gained autocephaly for the Serbian Church in 1219 and authored the oldest known constitution, and at the same time Stefan the First-Crowned established the Serbian Kingdom in 1217. Medieval Serbia reached its peak during the reign of Stefan Dusan (1331-1355), who took advantage of the Byzantine civil war and doubled the size of the state by conquering territories to the south and east at the expense of Byzantium, reaching as far as the Peloponnese, also being crowned Emperor of Serbs and Greeks in 1346.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Battle of Kosovo against the rising Ottoman Empire in 1389 marks a turning point and is considered as a beginning of the fall of the medieval Serbian state. The magnate families Lazarevic and Brankovic ruled the suzerain Serbian Despotate afterwards (in the 15th and 16th centuries). After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 and the Siege of Belgrade, the Serbian Despotate fell in 1459 following the siege of the provisional capital of Smederevo. By 1455, central Serbia was completely conquered by the Ottoman Empire.

		<English>[TAB]The term "barbarian" was created by the Greeks; it was originally used to denote any foreigner. Since then it has gained a more negative connotation, and it is commonly applied to civilizations deemed "inferior" to one's own. The Chinese, for instance, thought of all foreign cultures - everybody from the Manchus to the Turks to the Europeans - as barbarians. Rome applied it to the Huns and the Germanic tribes, as well as to the more advanced Gauls.[PARAGRAPH:1]In Civilization IV, the term denotes people that are not part of any organized civilization appearing in the game, but are instead old-style hunter-gatherers who prey on the "weak" civilized world. Though some barbarians may have acquired fairly advanced weaponry - swords and axes, for example - and though they may occasionally capture or even build their own cities, they remain at heart brigandic nomads, destroying everything that comes in their path. Barbarians cannot be bargained with or appeased: they must be destroyed - before they destroy you!</English>
		<French>[TAB]Le terme "Barbare" est &#224; l'origine un crit&#232;re linguistique utilis&#233; par les Grecs pour d&#233;signer toute personne &#233;trang&#232;re &#224; la civilisation grecque. Depuis, ce terme a pris une connotation p&#233;jorative et s'applique aux civilisations jug&#233;es "inf&#233;rieures". Les Chinois, par exemple, consid&#233;raient toutes les cultures &#233;trang&#232;res, des Mandchous aux Turcs en passant par les Europ&#233;ens, comme des barbares. Rome utilisait ce terme pour d&#233;signer les Huns, les Gaulois et les tribus germaniques.[PARAGRAPH:2]Dans Civilization IV, le terme "Barbares" d&#233;signe des gens qui ne font partie d'aucune civilisation organis&#233;e du jeu. Il s'agit de chasseurs-cueilleurs qui n'ont pas peur de s'attaquer au monde civilis&#233;. Bien que certains barbares aient pu acqu&#233;rir un armement assez avanc&#233;, avec notamment des &#233;p&#233;es et des haches, et bien qu'ils puissent &#224; l'occasion capturer ou m&#234;me fonder leurs propres villes, ils restent avant tout des "bandits-nomades", d&#233;truisant tout sur leur passage. Il est impossible de n&#233;gocier avec des barbares ni m&#234;me de les apaiser : il faut les &#233;liminer avant qu'ils ne vous &#233;liminent !</French>
		<German>[TAB]Der Begriff "Barbar" kommt aus dem Griechischen und bezeichnete in seiner urspr&#252;nglichen Bedeutung alle Nichtgriechen. Seither haftete dem Wort allerdings eine immer negativere Assoziation an und heute wird es im Allgemeinen als Bezeichnung f&#252;r primitivere, "unterlegenere" Zivilisationen verwendet. Die Chinesen betrachteten beispielsweise alle fremden Kulturen - wirklich alle, von den Manchus &#252;ber die T&#252;rken bis hin zu den Europ&#228;ern - als Barbaren. Rom benutzte den Begriff f&#252;r die Hunnen und die germanischen St&#228;mme sowie f&#252;r die immerhin etwas fortschrittlicheren Gallier.[PARAGRAPH:2]In Civilization IV sind mit den "Barbaren" V&#246;lker gemeint, die keiner der organisierten Zivilisationen im Spiel angeh&#246;ren, sondern eher in die Kategorie "J&#228;ger und Sammler" eingeordnet werden k&#246;nnen und die "schwache" zivilisierte Welt mit &#220;berf&#228;llen heimsuchen. Zwar gibt es vereinzelt Barbaren, die &#252;ber relativ fortschrittliche Waffen verf&#252;gen - zum Beispiel Schwerter und &#196;xte - und sie k&#246;nnen auch gelegentlich St&#228;dte erobern oder sogar eigene St&#228;dte gr&#252;nden, dennoch bleiben sie im Herzen stets r&#228;uberische Nomaden, die alles zerst&#246;ren, was sich ihnen in den Weg stellt. Barbaren lassen sich nicht beschwichtigen und auch nicht mit sich handeln - deshalb sollten sie m&#246;glichst schnell vernichtet werden, bevor sie eine ernsthafte Bedrohung darstellen.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]Il termine "barbaro" venne coniato dai Greci e inizialmente veniva utilizzato per indicare qualsiasi straniero. Da allora, la parola ha assunto una connotazione negativa e viene associato a quelle civilt&#224; definite "inferiori". I Cinesi, per esempio, identificavano tutte le culture straniere come "barbare" dai Manci&#249; ai Turchi agli Europei. Roma boll&#242; con questo termine gli Unni e le popolazioni germaniche, cos&#236; come i Galli che erano culturalmente evoluti.[PARAGRAPH:2]In Civilization IV, questo termine indica le popolazioni che non fanno parte di una civilt&#224; organizzata, vecchi cacciatori che predano i "deboli" nel mondo. Malgrado alcuni barbari abbiano conquistato armamenti pi&#249; evoluti come spade e asce, e talvolta possano conquistare o fondare delle citt&#224;, i Barbari rimangono prevalentemente nomadi che distruggono e saccheggiano tutto ci&#242; che capita a tiro.

		<Spanish>[TAB]El t&#233;rmino "b&#225;rbaro" fue acu&#241;ado por los griegos, y originalmente se utilizaba para referirse a cualquier extranjero. Pero desde entonces ha adquirido unas connotaciones negativas, pues suele emplearse al hablar de las civilizaciones a las que se considera "inferiores" a la propia. Los chinos, por ejemplo, pensaban que todas las culturas extranjeras (desde los manch&#250;es a los turcos, pasando por los europeos) eran b&#225;rbaras. En Roma se empleaba el t&#233;rmino para referirse a los hunos y las tribus germanas, as&#237; como a los galos, que eran m&#225;s avanzados.[PARAGRAPH:2]En Civilization IV, este t&#233;rmino engloba a todos los pueblos que no forman parte de ninguna civilizaci&#243;n organizada del juego, y en lugar de eso se componen de cazadores-recolectores que atacan al "d&#233;bil" mundo civilizado. Aunque algunos b&#225;rbaros pueden llegar a adquirir armas bastante avanzadas (espadas y hachas, por ejemplo), y aunque de vez en cuando pueden capturar ciudades o construir las suyas propias, en el fondo siguen siendo unos n&#243;madas bandidos que lo destruyen todo a su paso.

		<English>[TAB]The Mongol tribes entered into history with the birth of Temujin, born in c.1167 AD in the wild steppe-land of Mongolia, which is bordered by modern China and Russia.  When Temujin was nine years old, tribal rivals poisoned and murdered his father Yesugei, creating a power vacuum in the tribe that resulted in the exile of young Temujin and his family as fugitives. In time Temujin would return to claim his inheritance, forge political alliances, and vanquish old rivals. In 1204 AD he summoned a kuriltai war council and proceeded to unite all local nomad tribes by force, becoming the first man ever to unite the Mongols. It was at this time he received the title 'Genghis Khan', meaning 'Great Ruler'. [PARAGRAPH:2]China, at the time, was divided into three parts: the Ch'in, who were the most powerful, reigned in the north at Beijing; the Sung occupied the South; and the Hsi-Hsia, the weakest of the 3, inhabited the western flank of the Great Wall.  The Mongol conquest against China began in 1211 when the consolidated tribes of the Great Khan struck at the Hsi-Hsia, with tremendous success.  Not impressed with the defeat of his weaker neighbor, the new Emperor of Ch'in insisted on a public display of servitude from Temujin. Temujin reacted by ordering a general advance against the Ch'in Empire.  The resulting war lasted for approximately 23 years, and ended in the complete destruction of the Ch'in. Although the Mongols began the war as nomadic horsemen, by the time they defeated the Ch'in they had learned how to use advanced siege weaponry to capture cities. During this campaign Temujin ensured that the epic war upon the Ch'in did not occupy all of his resources and time; there were older enemies to address. [PARAGRAPH:2]Amid the war against the Ch'in the Mongols also rallied against the Kara-Khitay, one of the original Kuchlug tribes that had fled from defeat during Temujin's war of unification.  Victory over the Kara-Khitay provided the Mongols a common frontier with the Shah of Khwarizm, who ruled a large Muslim state that stretched from modern day Iran to southern Russia as far as the Caspian and Aral Seas.  Temujin initially attempted to establish friendly relations with the Shah Ala-al-Din, but he was contemptuously rebuffed, and the Mongol emissary killed. That was a mistake. In 1219 a Mongol horde estimated at 100,000 horsemen invaded Khwarizm and the other cities that lay along the rich Silk Way. Due to their stubborn resistance, the cities of Khwarizm were destroyed, their populations slaughtered or enslaved, and the area almost completely depopulated. Ala-al-Din fled in exile and died shortly thereafter. In many respects, this area today still has not recovered from the Mongol invasion.[PARAGRAPH:2]After destroying Khwarizm, the Mongols had access to Russia.  Not content with remaining a peaceful neighbor, Temujin's successor Ogodai permitted his generals to lead an extraordinary campaign into southern Russia, which would be staged largely in the winter months. In a series of campaigns between 1237-40, the Mongols completely subjected the various principalities of Russia, destroying anyone who opposed them. From Russia, the Mongols continued their western advance by invading Poland, Silesia, and Hungary. They easily defeated the armies of Poland, Germany, and Hungary, and appeared poised to erupt into Western Europe. But the death of Ogodai, the great khan, caused the armies to retreat in order to seek new orders, thus sparing most of Europe from destruction. Less fortunate was the Muslim world, as Baghdad was sacked in 1258 by yet another Mongol army and the Caliph executed by being trampeled to death beneath Mongol horses. The destruction of Baghdad and slaughtering of its population was a blow that the Arab Empire of the Caliphs never fully recovered from. The Mongols were finally turned back for the first time by the Mameluks of Egypt in 1260.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mongol children were taught to ride on horseback from the age of three, and were given bow and arrows to use for hunting at the age of five. Horseback riding became a natural way for the Mongols to conduct war.  When speed was essential, a Mongol rider could even sleep while in the saddle; and by using a system that consisted of approximately four remounts, Temujin's army was capable of traversing 130 miles in two days, with no breaks for food. Another defining characteristic of a Mongolian army was the speed and voracity with which it was able to accept and prepare for battle.  The Mongols' harsh, nomadic lifestyle had prepared them well for the rigors of war; and they often thrived in conditions that would be considered intolerable by any other military of its time.  When the need arose they could last up to ten days at a time without cooking food, during which they would sustain themselves by drinking the blood of their horses. Their primary weapon consisted of horse archers called Keshiks, who could fire with great speed and incredible accuracy from the back of a saddle. The mobility of the Mongol forces gave them a great tactical advantage within battles that Mongol generals would exploit over and over again.[PARAGRAPH:2]Every victory wrought by the Mongols was followed by slaughters of incredible scale.  No citizens, with the exception of those who were useful to the Mongol war effort, were spared in these attacks.  In 1221, the Islamic city of Merv was captured; 700,000 were murdered (this number is almost certainly exaggerated but still amazing), and a rearguard was assembled to dispatch any citizens who were fortunate enough to have escaped the original slaughter - this was routine work for the Mongol army. It is said that Temujin planned to depopulate northern China for use as a pasture for his livestock, until being told that subjects would pay more in taxes than cattle.[PARAGRAPH:2]By the end of the 13th century Mongol armies had been involved in action in countries including: Poland, Japan, Korea, Hungary, Russia, Palestine, Egypt, Persia, India, China, Cambodia, Burma, Vietnam, and Indonesia.  After Temujin's death in 1227 five more Khans would follow, including Kublai Khan, whose triumph was the union of all of China under his rule.  However, the death of Kublai Khan in 1294 AD marked the end of an era for Mongol conquests, and the march of Mongol armies began to decline. While many of the khanates founded by the Mongols lasted for several more centuries, the age of the great nomadic forces was over. Although their era was brief in duration, the Mongols conquered the largest empire the world has ever seen and terrorized virtually the entire Eurasian continent.</English>
		<French>[TAB]The Mongol tribes entered into history with the birth of Temujin, born in c.1167 AD in the wild steppe-land of Mongolia, which is bordered by modern China and Russia.  When Temujin was nine years old, tribal rivals poisoned and murdered his father Yesugei, creating a power vacuum in the tribe that resulted in the exile of young Temujin and his family as fugitives. In time Temujin would return to claim his inheritance, forge political alliances, and vanquish old rivals. In 1204 AD he summoned a kuriltai war council and proceeded to unite all local nomad tribes by force, becoming the first man ever to unite the Mongols. It was at this time he received the title 'Genghis Khan', meaning 'Great Ruler'. [PARAGRAPH:2]China, at the time, was divided into three parts: the Ch'in, who were the most powerful, reigned in the north at Beijing; the Sung occupied the South; and the Hsi-Hsia, the weakest of the 3, inhabited the western flank of the Great Wall.  The Mongol conquest against China began in 1211 when the consolidated tribes of the Great Khan struck at the Hsi-Hsia, with tremendous success.  Not impressed with the defeat of his weaker neighbor, the new Emperor of Ch'in insisted on a public display of servitude from Temujin. Temujin reacted by ordering a general advance against the Ch'in Empire.  The resulting war lasted for approximately 23 years, and ended in the complete destruction of the Ch'in. Although the Mongols began the war as nomadic horsemen, by the time they defeated the Ch'in they had learned how to use advanced siege weaponry to capture cities. During this campaign Temujin ensured that the epic war upon the Ch'in did not occupy all of his resources and time; there were older enemies to address.

		<English>[H1]Genghis Khan [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Khan of the Mongol Empire [\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1152/1167 - 1227[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]The Khan who founded the world's largest empire was given the name Temujin at birth. At his death, Temujin's empire encompassed over 13.8 million square miles and 100 million people, about half of the world's entire population. [PARAGRAPH:1]Temujin was born into a family of the minor Mongol nobility. His father was murdered when he was nine, leaving his mother to teach Temujin how to ride a horse, shoot a bow, and tend the animals. She also taught her son that allies were crucial to one's survival, and Temujin took this lesson to heart. By the time Temujin had reached his late teens, he had gathered to him a group of very loyal vassals, with whom he shared the spoils of his wars. He also became blood brothers with men from the leading Mongol families. However, Temujin was first and foremost a pragmatist; he would remain friends with these leaders as long as it suited him and he would discard or betray them at need. [PARAGRAPH:1]Temujin grew in power and prominence, and he was eventually accepted as leader of all of the Mongols. He reorganized the military, promoting men of competence rather than men of good breeding. This gave him the unwavering backing of the common soldiers and the officers. After defeating his last internal foe, Temujin was named "Genghis Kahn," meaning either "Oceanic Ruler" (or possibly "Fierce Ruler"). After fully securing his position at home, Kahn began his extraordinary series of conquests across Asia and Europe. [PARAGRAPH:1]Genghis Khan was far more interested in victory than he was in glory in battle. Before attacking a city or country, Genghis Khan sent the local rulers "orders of submission," in which he demanded immediate surrender. If the rulers did so, they were allowed to continue governing as long as they provided him tribute in money and labor. If the rulers did not surrender, they could expect little mercy once defeated. [PARAGRAPH:1]As a political leader, Genghis Kahn adopted a policy of religious tolerance, which eased tensions with the local priests. He recruited foreigners to serve as officers in his army and in his government, allowing them to rise to prominence according to their abilities, thus giving the ablest men reason to support him rather than to plot against him. He issued a set of laws for his conquered lands, which among other things punished horse theft with death and imposed severe punishment on disobedient soldiers. He also allowed full trade with Europe, and for the first time it was possible for European merchants to travel all the way to China in (relative) safety. [PARAGRAPH:1]As a military leader, Genghis Khan was exceptional. He maintained tight discipline among his troops, punishing them severely for infractions. He developed a sophisticated intelligence network across Asia, and he used the intelligence to craft clever military campaigns that fully exploited his enemy's weaknesses. Genghis Khan's troops were extraordinary, as well. The Mongols were superb light cavalrymen, and their ability to shoot arrows from the saddle was unbelievable. At first his armies were ignorant of the arts of siege warfare, but as more and more armies refused to meet his forces in the open field; his men grew skilled with catapults and the other tools for fighting men behind walls. [PARAGRAPH:1]Genghis Khan's first campaigns were against the Tanguts, who controlled the lucrative trade routes between the East and West. After subduing them, he conquered other foes in Central Asia and Northern China. No one could stand against him. During his last and most extraordinary campaign, he set out with 200,000 warriors and captured Bukhara, Samarkand, Balkh, Nishapur and Herat in succession. After remaining in Central Asia for four years, Genghis Khan headed back home, only to die en route. [PARAGRAPH:1]Something more than a barbarian and something less than an enlightened ruler, Genghis Khan remains one of the most extraordinary warrior-kings of all time.</English>

A sa mort, son empire couvre plus de 35,8 millions de kilom&#232;tres carr&#233;s et comprend 100 millions d'habitants, soit pr&#232;s de la moiti&#233; de la population mondiale. [PARAGRAPH:1] Tem&#252;djin na&#238;t dans une famille de la petite noblesse mongole. Son p&#232;re est assassin&#233; alors qu'il n'a que neuf ans, obligeant sa m&#232;re &#224; lui apprendre comment monter un cheval, bander un arc et garder les animaux. Elle lui enseigne &#233;galement que les alli&#233;s sont essentiels &#224; sa survie et Tem&#252;djin prend cette le&#231;on tr&#232;s &#224; coeur. A la fin de son adolescence, il peut compter sur un groupe de vassaux extr&#234;mement loyaux avec qui il partage ses butins de guerre. Il devient par ailleurs fr&#232;re de sang avec les hommes d'autres grandes familles mongoles mais il reste pragmatique : il restera ami avec ces chefs tant que cela lui conviendra mais il s'en d&#233;barrassera ou les trahira si besoin est. [PARAGRAPH:1]Tem&#252;djin renforce son pouvoir et sa renomm&#233;e et finit par se faire accepter comme chef de tous les Mongols. Il r&#233;organise l'arm&#233;e, promouvant les hommes en fonction de leurs comp&#233;tences et non de leur origine sociale, ce qui lui vaut le fid&#232;le soutien des simples soldats et des officiers. Une fois son dernier ennemi personnel &#233;limin&#233;, Tem&#252;djin se fait proclamer "Gengis Kahn", ce qui signifie soit le "Souverain oc&#233;anique", soit le "Chef supr&#234;me". Apr&#232;s avoir assur&#233; ses positions dans son pays, Khan entreprend d'extraordinaires conqu&#234;tes en Asie et en Europe. [PARAGRAPH:1]Sur le champ de bataille, Gengis Khan donne plus d'importance &#224; la victoire qu'&#224; la bataille. Avant d'attaquer une ville ou un pays, il envoie aux chefs locaux des "ordres de soumission" dans lesquels il a coutume de demander la capitulation imm&#233;diate. S'ils acceptent, ils sont autoris&#233;s &#224; continuer &#224; gouverner tant qu'ils lui fournissent un tribut en monnaie ou en travail. Dans le cas contraire, ils doivent s'attendre &#224; peu de cl&#233;mence apr&#232;s leur d&#233;faite. [PARAGRAPH:1]Comme chef politique, Gengis Kahn adopte une politique de tol&#233;rance religieuse qui r&#233;duit les tensions avec les pr&#234;tres locaux. Il recrute des &#233;trangers qui servent comme officiers dans son arm&#233;e et son gouvernement et leur offre de gravir les &#233;chelons selon leurs m&#233;rites, donnant ainsi plus de raisons &#224; ces hommes talentueux de le soutenir. Il proclame plusieurs lois destin&#233;es aux territoires conquis qui punissent notamment de mort le vol de chevaux et impose de s&#233;v&#232;res punitions aux soldats d&#233;sob&#233;issants. Il autorise &#233;galement, sans aucune restriction, le commerce avec l'Europe et, pour la premi&#232;re fois, il est possible aux marchands europ&#233;ens de voyager jusqu'en Chine en (relative) s&#233;curit&#233;. [PARAGRAPH:1]Comme chef militaire, Gengis Khan est exceptionnel. Il maintient une discipline stricte au sein de ses troupes, les punissant s&#233;v&#232;rement pour toute infraction. Il d&#233;veloppe un r&#233;seau sophistiqu&#233; de renseignements dans toute l'Asie et utilise ce service pour pr&#233;parer d'habiles campagnes militaires qui exploitent parfaitement les faiblesses de l'ennemi. Les troupes de Gengis Khan sont toutes aussi exceptionnelles. Les Mongols forment une remarquable cavalerie l&#233;g&#232;re et leur capacit&#233; &#224; tirer des fl&#232;ches en selle est impressionnante. A l'origine, les arm&#233;es de Gengis Khan ignorent tout de l'art de la guerre de si&#232;ge mais face au refus de leurs ennemis pour les affrontements &#224; d&#233;couvert, ses hommes se dotent de catapultes et autres outils qui permettent de combattre des hommes abrit&#233;s par des murs. [PARAGRAPH:1]Les premi&#232;res campagnes de Gengis Khan l'opposent aux Tangoutes, qui contr&#244;lent les lucratives routes commerciales entre l'Orient et l'Occident. Apr&#232;s les avoir soumis, il combat d'autres ennemis en Asie centrale et en Chine du Nord. Aucun peuple ne lui r&#233;siste.

		<German>[H1]Dschinghis Khan [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Khan des Mongolenreichs [\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte: [\BOLD] 1152 oder 1167-1227[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Dschingis Khan, oder Temudschin, war ein Khan der Mongolen, der die turko-mongolischen St&#228;mme vereinte und weite Teile Zentralasiens und Nordchinas kontrollierte. Als er starb, umfasste sein Reich mehr als 35 Millionen Quadratkilometer Land mit 100 Millionen Menschen ... mehr als die H&#228;lfte der Weltbev&#246;lkerung. [PARAGRAPH:1]Temudschin stammte aus einer hoch angesehenen Familie und wurde als &#228;ltester Sohn des Clanchefs Yes&#252;gai Bahadur geboren. Nach der Ermordung seines Vaters lebte der erst 9-j&#228;hrige Temudschin mit seiner Mutter und seinen Geschwistern in bitterer Armut. Angeblich hat Temudschins Mutter den sich st&#228;ndig streitenden Br&#252;dern mit einem Gleichnis die Bedeutung von St&#228;rke durch Einigkeit verdeutlicht. Sie forderte die Jungen zun&#228;chst auf, einen Pfeil zu zerbrechen. Anschlie&#223;end band sie mehrere Pfeile zusammen und befahl ihren Kindern, diese ebenfalls zu zerbrechen. Da dies nicht gelang, war die Belehrung seiner Mutter f&#252;r den sp&#228;teren Gro&#223;khan ein pr&#228;gendes Erlebnis. Dank seines dipolmatischen Geschicks fand er einige treue Gefolgsleute, denen er als Anreiz f&#252;r ihre Treue reiche Beute auf zuk&#252;nftigen Feldz&#252;gen zusicherte. Allerdings war und blieb Temudschin ein Pragmatiker, der wusste, dass er sich nicht blind auf die Loyalit&#228;t seiner Gefolgsleute und Blutsbr&#252;der verlassen durfte. [PARAGRAPH:1]Nachdem er die Steppenst&#228;mme vereint und seine gef&#228;hrlichsten Gegner unterworfen hatte, f&#252;hrte er einen blutigen Feldzug gegen die M&#246;rder seines Vaters: die Tataren. Im Jahr 1206 berief Temudschin einen Reichstag (Kuriltai) ein. Dort wurde er von den anwesenden Schamanen und Stammesf&#252;rsten zum Dschingis Khan, dem Gro&#223;khan aller Mongolen erhoben und bekam damit als erster Khan den Titel "ungest&#252;mer Herrscher" (oder "ozeangleicher Herrscher"). Nachdem er seine Macht gefestigt hatte, begann Temudschin einen nie da gewesenen Eroberungsfeldzug quer durch Asien und Europa. [PARAGRAPH:1]Temudschin ging es allein um den Sieg. Bevor er eine Stadt oder ein Land attackierte, schickte er dem Herrscher den "Befehl zur Unterwerfung" und forderte dessen Kapitulation. Folgte der Herrscher diesem Befehl, blieb er im Amt, musste den Mongolen jedoch Tribut zollen. Weigerte er sich, l&#246;schten die Mongolen nicht selten ganze St&#228;dte aus. [PARAGRAPH:1]Dschinghis Khan vertrat eine Politik der religi&#246;sen Toleranz, um die Spannungen zwischen ihm und den &#246;rtlichen Priestern beizulegen. Er rekrutierte Fremde als Offiziere und berief sie in seine Regierung, um sie an sich zu binden und die Gefahr eines Aufstandes zu verringern. In den von ihm eroberten L&#228;ndern rief er Gesetze ins Leben, die beispielsweise Pferdediebstahl mit dem Tode bestraften und drakonische Strafen f&#252;r milit&#228;rischen Ungehorsam vorsahen. Ferner f&#246;rderte er den Handel mit Europa. Europ&#228;ische H&#228;ndler konnten nun erstmals (relativ) sicher bis nach China reisen. [PARAGRAPH:1]Dschinghis Khan war ein brillanter Kommandeur, der seine Soldaten mit harter Hand disziplinierte. Dank eines ausgekl&#252;gelten Spionagenetzwerks in ganz Asien war er in der Lage, die Schw&#228;chen seiner Feinde zu erkennen und zu nutzen. Dies erm&#246;glichte ihm die Kontrolle seiner perfekt ausgebildeten Soldaten, die wie keine andere Kavallerie der damaligen Zeit in der Lage waren, vom R&#252;cken ihrer Pferde zu k&#228;mpfen. Anfangs waren Temudschins Armeen keine Belagerungsheere. Als jedoch immer mehr Gegner eine offene Schlacht mit den Mongolen scheuten, setzten diese vermehrt Katapulte und andere Belagerunfswaffen ein.[PARAGRAPH:1]Temudschins erste Kriegsz&#252;ge richteten sich gegen die Tanguten, die die lukrativen Handelsrouten zwischen dem Osten und dem Westen kontrollierten. Nach ihrer Unterwerfung eroberte er weite Teile Zentralasiens und Nordchinas. Niemand konnte sich ihm widersetzen. Im Laufe seines letzten Feldzugs eroberte er mit 20.000 Kriegern Bukhara, Samarkand, Balkh, Nishapur und Herat. 1227 starb Dschingis Khan w&#228;hrend eines neuerlichen Feldzugs gegen die Tanguten. [PARAGRAPH:1]Dschinghis Khan war weder ein Barbar, noch ein aufgekl&#228;rter Herrscher.

Alla sua morte, l'impero di Temujin contava quasi 14 milioni di miglia quadrate di territorio e 100 milioni di abitanti, circa la met&#224; della popolazione mondiale dell'epoca.[PARAGRAPH:1]Temujin nacque in una famiglia della nobilt&#224; minore mongola: suo padre venne assassinato quando aveva soltanto nove anni, lasciando alla madre il compito di addestrarlo a cavalcare un cavallo, tirare con l'arco e accudire gli animali. Ella gli insegn&#242; anche che gli alleati erano fondamentali per la sopravvivenza, lezione che Temujin apprese alla perfezione. Poco prima di compiere vent'anni, Temujin aveva riunito intorno a s&#233; un gruppo di vassalli leali, con i quali aveva condiviso le spoglie di guerra. Inoltre, divenne fratello di sangue con i membri delle maggiori famiglie nobili dei Mongoli. Tuttavia, Temujin era innanzitutto una persona pratica: avrebbe mantenuto la sua amicizia con questi leader finch&#233; gli sarebbero tornati utili e li avrebbe abbandonati o traditi non appena se ne fosse presentato il bisogno.[PARAGRAPH:1]Temujin acquis&#236; potere e prestigio e venne infine accettato come leader di tutti i Mongoli. Riorganizz&#242; l'esercito e promosse gli uomini capaci, piuttosto che quelli di nobile nascita: questo gli concesse il fermo appoggio dei soldati e degli ufficiali comuni. Una volta eliminati i nemici interni, Temujin venne nominato "Genghis Khan", ovvero "dominatore oceanico" o anche "feroce governatore". Dopo aver reso solida la propria posizione in patria, Khan diede inizi&#242; alla sua straordinaria serie di conquiste attraverso l'Asia e l'Europa.[PARAGRAPH:1]Genghis Khan era pi&#249; interessato alla vittoria che alla gloria della battaglia: prima di attaccare un paese, Khan inviava ai governatori locali un "ordine di sottomissione", nel quale chiedeva la resa immediata. Se i governatori accettavano, avrebbero potuto continuare a governare, fornendogli dei tributi in denaro e manodopera, altrimenti non avrebbero ricevuto alcuna piet&#224; una volta sconfitti.[PARAGRAPH:1]Come capo politico, Genghis Khan adott&#242; una linea di tolleranza religiosa, che smorz&#242; le tensioni con i sacerdoti locali. Egli reclutava anche degli stranieri per coprire le cariche di ufficiali dell'esercito e del governo, fornendo ai suoi uomini un ulteriore motivo per supportarlo, piuttosto che complottare alle sue spalle. Eman&#242; una serie di leggi per le terre conquistate che, tra le altre cose, punivano con la morte il furto di cavalli e aggravavano le pene per la disobbedienza dei soldati. Infine, consent&#236; il commerci&#242; con l'Europa e per la prima volta ai mercanti europei fu concesso di raggiungere la Cina in (relativa) sicurezza.[PARAGRAPH:1]Come capo militare, Genghis Khan fu eccezionale: mantenne una stretta disciplina tra le truppe, punendole severamente per qualsiasi infrazione. Svilupp&#242; un'avanzata rete informativa per tutta l'Asia e sfrutt&#242; le informazioni ottenute per progettare accuratamente le campagne militari, sfruttando i punti deboli dei nemici. Anche le truppe di Genghis Khan erano straordinarie: i Mongoli erano degli eccellenti cavalleggeri e la loro abilit&#224; con l'arco in sella era incredibile. Inizialmente, l'esercito non era esperto nelle arti della guerra d'assedio, ma, mano a mano che i nemici rifiutarono di affrontare le truppe in campo aperto, i suoi uomini acquisirono dimestichezza con le catapulte e gli altri strumenti per l'assedio delle fortificazioni.[PARAGRAPH:1]Le prima campagne militari di Genghis Khan si svolsero contro i Tanguti, che controllavano le proficue rotte commerciali tra l'Est e l'Ovest. Dopo averli soggiogati, Khan sconfisse gli altri nemici dell'Asia Centrale e della Cina del Nord. Nessuno poteva opporsi alla sua avanzata. Durante la sua ultima e straordinaria campagna, part&#236; con 200.000 guerrieri e conquist&#242;, in ordine, Bukhara, Samarcanda, Balkh, Nishapur e Herat. Dopo essere rimasto in Asia Centrale per quattro anni, Genghis Khan fece ritorno a casa, morendo lungo il viaggio.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pi&#249; di un barbaro e meno di un governatore illuminato, Genghis Khan rimane uno dei re guerrieri pi&#249; straordinari di tutti i tempi.</Italian>

Tambi&#233;n forj&#243; lazos de sangre con miembros de las principales familias mongolas.

[PARAGRAPH:1]Poco a poco, su poder e influencia fueron aumentando, hasta que finalmente fue aceptado como l&#237;der de todos los mongoles. Reorganiz&#243; el ej&#233;rcito, promocionando a los hombres en funci&#243;n de su competencia y no de su ascendencia. Esto le proporcion&#243; el apoyo incondicional de los soldados y los oficiales. Tras derrotar al &#250;ltimo de sus adversarios internos, Temujin recibi&#243; el nombre de "Gengis Kan," que significa "Se&#241;or Oce&#225;nico" (o, posiblemente "Se&#241;or Fiero"). Tras asegurar su posici&#243;n en su propio pa&#237;s, Kan inici&#243; una extraordinaria serie de conquistas por Asia y Europa. [PARAGRAPH:1]Por encima de la gloria en el campo de batalla, lo que interesaba a Gengis Kan era la victoria.

Si obedec&#237;an, los gobernantes pod&#237;an conservar el puesto mientras le proporcionaran un tributo en met&#225;lico y en mano de obra.

Reclut&#243; extranjeros para que lo ayudaran en el ej&#233;rcito y el gobierno, permitiendo que ascendieran en funci&#243;n de sus m&#233;ritos. Con esta medida daba a los m&#225;s capaces una raz&#243;n para apoyarlo en lugar de conspirar en su contra. Promulg&#243; una serie de leyes para los territorios conquistados que, por poner varios ejemplos, establec&#237;an la pena capital para el robo de caballos e impon&#237;an severos castigos para los soldados desobedientes. Tambi&#233;n permiti&#243; que el comercio con Europa fluyera sin interrupciones y as&#237;, por primera vez, fue posible que los mercaderes europeos viajaran hasta China con (relativa) seguridad.

Sus tropas tambi&#233;n eran extraordinarias. La caballer&#237;a ligera mongola era formidable y su capacidad para disparar sin desmontar, prodigiosa. Al principio sus ej&#233;rcitos no dominaban el arte del asedio, pero a medida que aumentaba el n&#250;mero de enemigos que se negaban a luchar contra ellos a campo abierto, sus hombres fueron dominando las catapultas y dem&#225;s instrumentos de poliorc&#233;tica.

		<English>[TAB]The Karakhanids were a Turkic dynasty that ruled parts of Central Asia from the 9th through early 13th centuries. Their arrival in Transoxania signaled a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia, though the Karakhanids themselves gradually assimilated the local Perso-Arab Muslim culture. [PARAGRAPH:1]The Kara-Khanid Khanate was a confederation formed in the early 9th century by the Karluks, Yagmas, Chigils, and other Turkic peoples living in the Zhetysu, Western Tian Shan, and Western Xinjiang areas. By the mid-10th century, the Karakhanids had converted to Islam, and adopted Muslim names and honorifics while retaining Turkic regnal titles such as Khan, Khagan, Ilek and Tegin. Later on their rulers adopted the title sultan, though as was common of Turkic and Mongol nomads the Kara-Khanid state remained divided into appanages. By 950, they had absorbed Kashgar and were waging religious war against their Buddhist and Tengrist neighbors, reportedly prompting a mass conversion of Turks in the year 960.[PARAGRAPH:1]Starting in 990 the Karakhanids began full scale invasions of the Samanid domains. By 999, the Samanids had been largely destroyed and their lands split between the Karakhanids and the Ghaznavids. In 1006, the Buddhist Kingdom of Khotan was conquered, and the Kara-Khanid state was at its greatest extent and arguable peak. Early in the 11th century however, the unity of the Kara-Khanid dynasty was fractured by frequent internal warfare, and the state was eventually split into two independent parts. This disunity would contribute to the Karakhanids being successively vassalized or conquered by their more powerful neighbors, including the Seljuks and the Kara Khitai. They were finally extinguised in the early 13th century by the the Khwarezmshah, the Kara Khitai, and the Mongols. </English>

		<English>[TAB]The Karakhanids were a Turkic dynasty that ruled parts of Central Asia from the 9th through early 13th centuries. Their arrival in Transoxania signaled a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia, though the Karakhanids themselves gradually assimilated the local Perso-Arab Muslim culture. [PARAGRAPH:1]The Kara-Khanid Khanate was a confederation formed in the early 9th century by the Karluks, Yagmas, Chigils, and other Turkic peoples living in the Zhetysu, Western Tian Shan, and Western Xinjiang areas. By the mid-10th century, the Karakhanids had converted to Islam, and adopted Muslim names and honorifics while retaining Turkic regnal titles such as Khan, Khagan, Ilek and Tegin. Later on their rulers adopted the title sultan, though as was common of Turkic and Mongol nomads the Kara-Khanid state remained divided into appanages. By 950, they had absorbed Kashgar and were waging religious war against their Buddhist and Tengrist neighbors, reportedly prompting a mass conversion of Turks in the year 960.[PARAGRAPH:1]Starting in 990 the Karakhanids began full scale invasions of the Samanid domains. By 999, the Samanids had been largely destroyed and their lands split between the Karakhanids and the Ghaznavids. In 1006, the Buddhist Kingdom of Khotan was conquered, and the Kara-Khanid state was at its greatest extent and arguable peak. Early in the 11th century however, the unity of the Kara-Khanid dynasty was fractured by frequent internal warfare, and the state was eventually split into two independent parts. This disunity would contribute to the Karakhanids being successively vassalized or conquered by their more powerful neighbors, including the Seljuks and the Kara Khitai. They were finally extinguised in the early 13th century by the the Khwarezmshah, the Kara Khitai, and the Mongols. </English>
		<French>[TAB]The Shaybanids are the patrilineal descendants of Shayban (Shiban), the fifth son of Jochi and grandson of Genghis Khan. Until the mid-14th century, they acknowledged the authority of the descendants of Batu Khan and Orda Khan, such as Uzbeg Khan. The Shaybanid horde was converted to Islam in 1282 and gradually assumed the name of Uzbeks.[PARAGRAPH:1]As the lineages of Batu and Orda died out in the course of the great civil wars of the 14th century, the Shaybanids under Abu'l-Khayr Khan declared themselves the only legitimate successors to Jochi and put forward claims to the whole of his enormous ulus, which included parts of Siberia and Kazakhstan. Their rivals were the Timurids, who claimed descent from Jochi's thirteenth son by a concubine. Several decades of strife left the Timurids in control of the Great Horde and its successor states in Europe, namely, the Khanates of Kazan, Astrakhan, and Crimea.[PARAGRAPH:1]However, the Shaybanids under Muhammad Shaybani were able to wrest control of Samarkand, Bukhara and (for a time) Herat from the Timurids, establishing the Shaybanid dynasty as rulers of the independent Khanates of Bukhora and Khwarezm (Khiva).</French>

Several decades of strife left the Timurids in control of the Great Horde and its successor states in Europe, namely, the Khanates of Kazan, Astrakhan, and Crimea.[PARAGRAPH:1]However, the Shaybanids under Muhammad Shaybani were able to wrest control of Samarkand, Bukhara and (for a time) Herat from the Timurids, establishing the Shaybanid dynasty as rulers of the independent Khanates of Bukhora and Khwarezm (Khiva).</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]The Kingdom of Makuria was a kingdom located in what is today Northern Sudan and Southern Egypt. It was one of a group of Nubian kingdoms that emerged during the decline of the Aksumite Empire, which it had been part of from approximately 4BC to AD 950. Makuria originally covered the area along the Nile River from the Third Cataract to somewhere between the Fifth and Sixth Cataracts.

Its capital was Dongola (Old Nubian: Tungul), and the kingdom is sometimes known by the name of its capital.[PARAGRAPH:1]By the end of the 6th century it had converted to Christianity, but in the 7th century Egypt was conquered by the Islamic armies, and Nubia was cut off from the rest of Christendom. In 651 an Arab army invaded, but it was repulsed and a treaty known as the baqt was signed creating a relative peace between the two sides that lasted until the 13th century. Makuria expanded, annexing its northern neighbour Nobatia either at the time of the Arab invasion or during the reign of King Merkurios. The period from roughly 750 to 1150 saw the kingdom stable and prosperous, in what has been called the "Golden Age".

		<English>[H1]Duwa[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Khan of the Chagatai Khanate[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Reigned:[\BOLD] 1282 - 1307[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Duwa was the second son of Chagatai khan Baraq. Kaidu, who held much of the power in the khanate, appointed Duwa as ruler in an effort to gain peace between himself and the sons of Baraq. This ensured the loyalty of the Chaghataids from that point until Kaidu's death. In early 1295, Kaidu's attempts to spread his power within the Ilkhanate gave Duwa an excuse to invade that Mongol kingdom. Supported by Kaidu's son Sarban, he invaded Khurasan and Mazandaran while the Ilkhanid commanders were involved in a succession struggle far to the west. For eight months he stayed in Mazandaran; when he left, he pillaged many cities on the way back. Duwa attempted to convince the Kartids of Herat to defect to his side, but they refused. Due to a lack of progress he was recalled by Kaidu back to Central Asia, and the campaign ended.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the east, Duwa was engaged in constant conflict with the Yuan dynasty. When Kaidu died after battling against the Yuan, the political situation changed. Duwa ignored Kaidu's choice of successor, Orus, and instead picked Kaidu's firstborn son Chapar to take his father's place. Chapar was enthroned in 1303, thanks to Duwa's effort. Duwa insisted Chapar submit to Temur Khan, and around 1304 a general peace among the Mongol states was declared, finally ending the Kaidu-Kublai war. The settlement favored Duwa much more than Chapar, a fact which set a rift between the two. Fighting broke out between the troops of both parties, and the sons of Kaidu were ultimately defeated by Duwa with assistance from the Yuan. In 1307 Duwa died, to be succeeded by his own son Konchek.</English>
