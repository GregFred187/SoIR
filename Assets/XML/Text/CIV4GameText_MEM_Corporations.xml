		<English>[TAB]Sufism is, according to its adherents, the inner, mystical dimension of Islam A practitioner of this tradition is generally known as a Sufi. Another name for a Sufi is Dervish.[PARAGRAPH:2]Classical Sufis were characterised by their attachment to dhikr (a practice of repeating the names of God) and asceticism. Sufism gained adherents among a number of Muslims as a reaction against the worldliness of the early Umayyad Caliphate (661-750 CE). The Sufi movement has spanned several continents and cultures over a millennium, at first expressed through Arabic, then through Persian, Turkish and a dozen other languages. "Orders" (turuq), which are either Sunni or Shi'i in doctrine, trace many of their original precepts from the Islamic Prophet Muhammad through his cousin 'Ali, with the notable exception of the Naqshbandi who trace their origins through the first Caliph, Abu Bakr.

Between the 13th and 16th centuries CE, Sufism produced a flourishing intellectual culture throughout the Islamic world, a "Golden Age" whose physical artifacts are still present. In many places, a lodge (known variously as a zaouia, khanqah, or tekke) would be endowed through a pious foundation in perpetuity (waqf) to provide a gathering place for Sufi adepts, as well as lodging for itinerant seekers of knowledge.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Sufismus ist nach Ansicht seiner Anhänger die innere, mystische Dimension des Islam. Ein Anhänger dieser Tradition wird allgemein als Sufi bezeichnet. Ein anderer Name für einen Sufi ist Derwisch.[PARAGRAPH:2]Klassische Sufis zeichneten sich durch ihre Bindung an Dhikr (eine Praxis, die Namen Gottes zu wiederholen) und Askese aus. Als Reaktion auf die Weltlichkeit des frühen Umayyaden-Kalifats (661-750 n. Chr.) gewann der Sufismus bei einer Reihe von Muslimen Anhänger. Die Sufi-Bewegung erstreckte sich über ein Jahrtausend über mehrere Kontinente und Kulturen und drückte sich zunächst auf Arabisch, dann auf Persisch, Türkisch und einem Dutzend anderer Sprachen aus. "Orden" (turuq), deren Lehre entweder sunnitisch oder schiitisch ist, gehen viele ihrer ursprünglichen Gebote auf den islamischen Propheten Muhammad und seinen Cousin Ali zurück, mit der bemerkenswerten Ausnahme der Naqshbandi, die ihre Ursprünge auf den ersten Kalifen zurückführen , Abu Bakr. Andere exklusive Schulen des Sufismus bezeichnen sich selbst eindeutig als "Sufi".[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Verbreitung des Sufismus gilt als entscheidender Faktor für die Verbreitung des Islam und für die Schaffung ganzheitlicher islamischer Kulturen, insbesondere in Afrika und Asien. Zwischen dem 13. und 16. Jahrhundert n. Chr. brachte der Sufismus in der gesamten islamischen Welt eine blühende intellektuelle Kultur hervor, ein "Goldenes Zeitalter", dessen physische Artefakte noch heute vorhanden sind. An vielen Orten wurde eine Loge (auch bekannt als Zaouia, Khanqah oder Tekke) durch eine fromme Stiftung auf Dauer (waqf) gestiftet, um Sufi-Adepten einen Treffpunkt zu bieten und umherziehenden Wissenssuchenden Unterkunft zu bieten.</German>

		<German>[TAB]Die Hashishiyya, aus der vermutlich das Wort "Assassin" stammt, war die arabische Bezeichnung des Nizari-Zweigs der ismailitischen schiitischen Muslime im Mittelalter. Die Nizariyya oder Hashishiyya, wie sie von ihren Feinden genannt wurden, trennten sich vom Fatimiden-Ismailien-Reich nach einem Streit über die Nachfolge ihres spirituellen und politischen Führers, des fatimidischen Kalifen Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah. [PARAGRAPH:2]Die Nizariyya formulierten eine Strategie zur Erlangung der Kontrolle über strategisch wichtige Festungen durch verdeckte Umsiedlung der örtlichen Bevölkerung, die innerhalb und um strategisch wichtige Festungen im ismailitischen Gebiet lebten. Sie gründeten eine neue Art von Staat innerhalb eines Staates, der aus einer Reihe befestigter "Insel"-Siedlungen inmitten eines Meeres der Feindseligkeit im heutigen Iran, Irak, Syrien und Libanon bestand. Der formelle Ursprung der Föderation der Assassinen geht auf das Jahr 1090 zurück, als Hassan-i Sabbah seine erste Festung in Daylam in der Festung Alamut südlich des Kaspischen Meeres errichtete. Alamut blieb bis zu seiner Zerstörung die Hauptstadt der Föderation der Assassinen und die Heimat ihrer Herrscher, die als "Die Herren von Alamut" bezeichnet wurden. [PARAGRAPH:2]Da die Nizariyya nicht in der Lage waren, eine konventionelle Militärarmee aufzustellen, entwickelten sie eine Form der asymmetrischen Kriegsführung, die den Akt des politischen Attentats in ein System des Überlebens und der Verteidigung gegen ihre Feinde verwandelte. Sie bildeten hochqualifizierte Schläferkommandos aus (ausgebildet in Sprachen, Wissenschaft, Handel usw.), bekannt als Fedayeen, die heimlich feindliche Stellungen infiltrierten und verdeckt blieben. Wenn Nizari-Zivilisten Pogromen ausgesetzt waren oder ihre Festungen unmittelbar angegriffen wurden, wurden die Fedayeen aktiviert, um einen Angriff zu verhindern.</German>

		<German>[TAB]Die Tempelritter waren ein heiliger Orden, der sich der Verteidigung der jungen Kreuzfahrerstaaten widmete, die während des Ersten Kreuzzugs gegen die muslimische Rückeroberung gegründet wurden. Der König von Jerusalem erlaubte ihnen, ihr Hauptquartier im Haupttempel von Jerusalem einzurichten, von dem sie ihren Namen erhielten. Als Gegenleistung für diese Gastfreundschaft schworen sie dem Thron Jerusalems die Treue. Sie nahmen an mehreren großen Schlachten teil und schlugen sich sehr gut; Dadurch erhöhte sich ihre Zahl erheblich. Schließlich wuchs ihre Macht so sehr - bis zu dem Punkt, dass sie eine Armee von fast 10.000 Rittern aufstellen und dennoch ihre Versprechen einhalten konnten, einzelne Städte zu besetzen -, dass der Papst beschloss, sie unter seine direkte Kontrolle zu stellen. [PARAGRAPH:2]Die Tapferkeit der Templer im Heiligen Land führte in Europa zu vielen Belohnungen; Ritter, die unter dem Roten Kreuz und dem Weißen Feld der Templer kämpften, fanden sich in ihren Heimatländern oft mit neuen Gütern und Burgen wieder. Dadurch erlangte der Orden enormen Reichtum, da die Großmeister das Vermögen des Ordens geschickt anlegten und mit Plünderungen Waren kauften und im gesamten Mittelmeerraum verkauften. [PARAGRAPH:2]Könige werden jedoch oft eifersüchtig auf wohlhabende Organisationen, über die sie kaum oder gar keine Kontrolle haben. Der französische König Philipp IV., dessen Schatzkammer geleert war und dessen Schulden aufgrund der ständigen Kriegsführung ungeheuer hoch waren, beschuldigte die Templer der Ketzerei und Blasphemie und beschlagnahmte fast ihren gesamten Reichtum in Frankreich. Andere Monarchen folgten diesem Beispiel und starteten ein Programm der Verfolgung und Unterdrückung, dessen Ziel hauptsächlich darin bestand, sich das Geld der Templer zu sichern. Hunderte Templer gaben unter Folter falsche Geständnisse der Ketzerei ab, andere wurden auf dem Scheiterhaufen verbrannt. Der Orden starb im frühen 14. Jahrhundert vollständig aus, als die gesamte Führung der Templer ermordet worden war.</German>

		<English>[TAB]In the High Middle Ages, Venice became wealthy through its control of trade between Europe and the Levant, and began to expand into the Adriatic Sea and beyond. Venice was involved in the Crusades almost from the very beginning; 200 Venetian ships assisted in capturing the coastal cities of Syria after the First Crusade, and in 1123 they were granted virtual autonomy in the Kingdom of Jerusalem through the Pactum Warmundi. In 1110, Ordelafo Faliero personally commanded a Venetian fleet of 100 ships to assist Baldwin I of Jerusalem in capturing the city of Sidon.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the 12th century, the republic built a big national shipyard which is today called Venetian Arsenal.

		<German>[TAB]Im Hochmittelalter erlangte Venedig durch die Kontrolle des Handels zwischen Europa und der Levante Reichtum und begann, in die Adria und darüber hinaus zu expandieren. Venedig war fast von Anfang an an den Kreuzzügen beteiligt; 200 venezianische Schiffe halfen nach dem Ersten Kreuzzug bei der Eroberung der Küstenstädte Syriens und erhielten 1123 durch das Pactum Warmundi praktisch Autonomie im Königreich Jerusalem. Im Jahr 1110 befehligte Ordelafo Faliero persönlich eine venezianische Flotte von 100 Schiffen, um Balduin I. von Jerusalem bei der Eroberung der Stadt Sidon zu unterstützen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Im 12. Jahrhundert errichtete die Republik eine große nationale Werft, die heute als venezianisches Arsenal bezeichnet wird. Durch den Aufbau neuer und mächtiger Flotten übernahm die Republik die Kontrolle über das östliche Mittelmeer. In Venedig wurde das erste Wechselgeschäft der Welt gegründet, um Händler aus ganz Europa zu unterstützen. Die Venezianer erlangten auch umfangreiche Handelsprivilegien im Byzantinischen Reich und ihre Schiffe versorgten das Reich häufig mit einer Marine.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die venezianische Flotte war für den Transport des Vierten Kreuzzugs von entscheidender Bedeutung, doch als die Kreuzfahrer die Schiffe nicht bezahlen konnten , nutzte der listige und manipulative Doge Enrico Dandolo schnell die Situation aus und bot den Kreuzfahrern einen Transport an, falls sie die (christliche) dalmatinische Stadt Zadar erobern sollten, die gegen die venezianische Herrschaft rebelliert hatte. Nachdem dies gelungen war, wurde der Kreuzzug erneut nach Konstantinopel, der Hauptstadt des Byzantinischen Reiches, einem weiteren Rivalen Venedigs, umgeleitet. Die Stadt wurde 1204 erobert und geplündert; Die Plünderung wurde als eine der profitabelsten und schändlichsten Plünderungen einer Stadt in der Geschichte beschrieben. Das Byzantinische Reich, das bis dahin mehreren Angriffen widerstanden und die islamischen Eindringlinge aus Westanatolien und Osteuropa ferngehalten hatte, wurde 1261 wiederhergestellt, erlangte jedoch nie seine frühere Macht zurück und wurde schließlich von den osmanischen Türken erobert. Die Venezianer, die die Kreuzfahrerflotte begleiteten, forderten einen Großteil der Beute aus der Stadt als Bezahlung, darunter auch die berühmten vier Bronzepferde, die zurückgebracht wurden, um die Markusbasilika zu schmücken. Als Folge der darauffolgenden Teilung des Byzantinischen Reiches gewann Venedig einige strategische Gebiete in der Ägäis (drei Achtel des Byzantinischen Reiches), darunter die Inseln Kreta und Euböa; Darüber hinaus verfügen einige heutige Städte, wie etwa Chania auf Kreta, über eine Kernarchitektur, die im Wesentlichen venezianischen Ursprungs ist. Die ägäischen Inseln bildeten das venezianische Herzogtum des Archipels.</German>
