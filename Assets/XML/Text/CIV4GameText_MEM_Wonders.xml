		<German>[TAB]Der Imam-Reza-Schrein in Mashhad, Iran, ist ein Komplex, der das Mausoleum von Imam Ridha, dem achten Imam der Zwölf Schiiten, enthält. Zu dem Komplex gehören außerdem: die Goharshad-Moschee, ein Museum, eine Bibliothek, vier Seminare, ein Friedhof, die Razavi-Universität für Islamische Wissenschaften, ein Speisesaal für Pilger, riesige Gebetshallen und andere Gebäude.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 818 soll Imam Reza von Al-Ma'mun den Märtyrertod erlitten und neben dem Grab von Harun begraben worden sein. Nach diesem Ereignis wurde dieser Ort Mashhad al-Rida (Ort des Martyriums von Ali al-Rida) genannt. Schiiten und Sunniten kamen dorthin, um zu seinem Grab zu pilgern. Ende des 9. Jahrhunderts wurde auf dem Grab eine Kuppel errichtet, und rundherum entstanden zahlreiche Gebäude und Basare. Im Laufe von mehr als einem Jahrtausend wurde es mehrmals zerstört und wieder aufgebaut.[PARAGRAPH:1]Im Jahr 993 wurde der heilige Schrein von Sabuktigin, einem ghaznavidischen König, zerstört. Im Jahr 1009 befahl sein Sohn Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi jedoch, den Schrein zu reparieren und zu erweitern. Um 1150 renovierte Sultan Sanjar, ein seldschukischer König, das Heiligtum und fügte neue Gebäude hinzu, nachdem sein Sohn im Schrein auf wundersame Weise geheilt worden war. Später renovierte Sultan Muhammad Khodabande, ein König der Ilchane, der zum Schiismus konvertierte, um 1310 die heilige Stätte. Der berühmte muslimische Reisende Ibn Battuta besuchte Mashhad im Jahr 1333 und berichtete, dass es sich um eine große Stadt mit reichlich Obstbäumen, Bächen und Mühlen handelte. Eine große, elegant gebaute Kuppel überragt das edle Mausoleum, die Wände sind mit farbigen Kacheln verziert. Gegenüber dem Grab des Imams befindet sich das Grab des Kalifen Harun al-Rashid, das von einer Plattform mit Kronleuchtern überragt wird.[PARAGRAPH:1]Im 15.

Im Jahr 1418 finanzierte seine Frau Goharshad den Bau einer herausragenden Moschee neben dem Schrein, die als Goharshad-Moschee bekannt ist.</German>

		<German>[TAB]Die ursprünglich von Konstantin dem Großen erbauten Mauern von Konstantinopel umgaben die neue Stadt von allen Seiten und schützten sie vor Angriffen vom Meer und vom Land aus. Als die Stadt wuchs, wurde im 5. Jahrhundert die berühmte Doppellinie der Theodosianischen Mauer errichtet. Obwohl die anderen Abschnitte der Mauern weniger aufwändig waren, waren sie, wenn sie gut bemannt waren, für jeden mittelalterlichen Belagerer fast uneinnehmbar und retteten die Stadt und mit ihr das Byzantinische Reich, während Belagerungen unter anderem durch die Awaren, Araber, Rus und Bulgaren . Erst das Aufkommen von Belagerungskanonen mit Schießpulver machte die Befestigungen überflüssig, was zur endgültigen Belagerung und dem Fall Konstantinopels durch die Osmanen am 29. Mai 1453 führte.</German>
